The fragile little snowflakes in the community mass-reported my review',"as usual","and the mods hacked away at the final paragraph."],comments:"Like any show, 86 has a lot of haters, but this is the first time I think I&rsquo;ve ever disliked a show this much for a reason unique to myself. I may be a better writer than some, and others may be better writers than me, but usually, everything bad anyone has to say about any show is criticism echoed by someone else. However, no one I&rsquo;ve seen seems to share my biggest single issue with 86. The first time I came into contact with this show was probably the first time you did too. I was just minding my own business, when suddenly the internet was flooded with pictures of the first volume&rsquo;s cover art. And wow! That cover art sure is pretty. Lena&rsquo;s gorgeous outfit, the artist&rsquo;s excellently balanced color contrast. Of course, it does a good job of conveying the intrigue in the story and the setting, but on an artistic level, everything about it was just so visually striking, and it&rsquo;s no surprise that book sold like hotcakes. When I went to investigate, the light novel only had a few thousand members on MAL, but the preliminary aggregate score was already a 9.00. Even after that initial buzz died down, I would always see that beautiful image in passing and wonder to myself, &ldquo;When will this get an anime?&rdquo; The second time I came into contact with 86 was when I watched the Eromanga Sensei OVAs. Eromanga Sensei was an abhorrent piece of trash, and not just because it was an incest show. Its characters, when they weren&rsquo;t being completely two dimensional, were just being horrible people, or confusing, or self-contradictory. It was always one of those. It had fan service, and I don&rsquo;t mind fan service, but here it was creepy, and the voyeuristic angles it took made me feel legitimately uncomfortable, like watching a hidden-camera show in a little girl&rsquo;s room. The OVA series wasn&rsquo;t hideously animated like the TV anime, but its writing didn&rsquo;t improve in the slightest. In the second episode of these OVAs, the main character gets sick, so two of his friends come over to help out. Unfortunately for them, his little sister (who is in love with him) doesn&rsquo;t want to let other women into the house to get close to her brother, so she refuses to let them in. They are for some reason okay with this, and they hand her the get-well present they brought for her brother to give him on their behalf. That present, to my surprise, was volume five of 86.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRight now, there&rsquo;s a show airing called Ousama Ranking, but its content doesn&rsquo;t matter. What matters is how it looks. When people first saw its storybook art style, they immediately distanced themselves from the show because, in their words, &ldquo;it looks like a kids show.&rdquo; I visited many of these peoples&rsquo; profile pages and wasn&rsquo;t shocked by what I found. Many considered Re:Zero and Demon Slayer to be among their favorite anime. Others considered My Hero Academia, Clannad, My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU, etc. I don&rsquo;t want to say anything judgmental or make any dangerously sweeping statements, because I know reviews can be taken down for less and people love mass-reporting my work, but those anime I just listed are, in fact, kids shows. &ldquo;What are you talking about? My Hero Academia has fan service and violence, My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU has &lsquo;mature themes&rsquo;, and Re:Zero and Demon Slayer have gore! How can you possibly call these kids shows?&rdquo; As an American living in the Bible Belt, I wasn&rsquo;t surprised when I learned Demon Slayer: Infinity Train was rated R17 by the MPAA, nor was I surprised to learn Eirin had rated it PG12 in Japan. They understand that while, yes, these anime contain certain words and certain images which may be seen as inappropriate, they also present these words and images with the gravity of kids shows. The fan service in anime like My Hero Academia is sexual, but it&rsquo;s not pornographic. It&rsquo;s comedic, and it&rsquo;s there not to violate the purity and innocence of children, but simply to keep the attention of horny kids going through puberty. The so-called &ldquo;mature themes&rdquo; in anime like My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU aren&rsquo;t mature in the slightest, consisting entirely of melodramatic high schoolers fumbling over their feelings, and shows like Re:Zero and Demon Slayer spend time on similarly juvenile bullshit and include cringeworthy meme comedy. As far as the gore goes, sure, I guess Subaru has some fairly visceral death scenes, but the fight scenes in Re:Zero are all cartoonish anime nonsense, and everything in Demon Slayer is outwardly silly no matter how conventionally graphic it may seem. Goons get shredded in underwater blenders, and others get their heads popped like balloons with goofy CG volleyballs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere&rsquo;s a lot wrong with 86, and I&rsquo;ll tackle all that in a second, but the main problem&mdash;which makes it almost completely unwatchable for me&mdash;is how much of a kids show it is. &ldquo;WHAT?! 86 is mature! It addresses themes of war, classism, and racism! It has intense scenes of violence and death! How can you POSSIBLY call it a kids show?!?!&rdquo; I knew 86 wasn&rsquo;t going to be worth the hype as soon as I saw it featured in that Eromanga Sensei OVA not because I&rsquo;m a cynical bitch who hates everything, but because I knew there was no way Dengeki Bunko would shill the light novel like that unless its fanbase had the exact same demographics as the viewers watching Eromanga Sensei. Yes, 86 is technically about war, and when you look at it from afar, you see war. Eromanga Sensei is technically about a damaged hikkikomori grappling with deep anxiety issues and the tragic loss of her parents, and when you look at it from afar, you see a damaged hikkikomori grappling with deep anxiety issues and the tragic loss of her parents. However, when you actually watch these shows, what do you really get? You get waifus and contrivance. This is not a show concerned with war, classism, or racism. It&rsquo;s a show concerned with waifus and contrivance, but it dresses itself up with paper-thin themes of war, classism, and racism in an attempt to make itself appear more sophisticated despite its obviously sophomoric grasp of such themes and to make its audience feel more intelligent for watching it. At least in my case, it failed to do so, because its tone shifts clash in such a jarring way. My brain can&rsquo;t reconcile the hard-ass war story with the waifu-bait trash. They&rsquo;re like oil and water, and the resulting anime is whatever greasy slime would result from such a mixture. You&rsquo;re of course missing the point if you think I&rsquo;m suggesting there can be absolutely no comedy, romance, or lightheartedness in a military drama whatsoever. That would be ridiculous. It&rsquo;s simply a matter of presentation, and this anime presents itself with frilly bra straps, goofy oujo-sama loli princesses, and chibi-faced moe blobs in military uniforms eating cake, exclaiming, &ldquo;Oishii!&rdquo; When I say &ldquo;kids show,&rdquo; I obviously don&rsquo;t mean you can throw on 86 for your five year old son after he&rsquo;s done watching Blue&rsquo;s Clues and Dora the Explorer and shit, but given the increasingly violent and sexual nature of video games and Hollywood film, I would be VERY surprised if your average twelve or thirteen year old child didn&rsquo;t find this show to be totally benign.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven if 86 didn&rsquo;t actively squander its tone, its actual content is just plain bad. I knew this series would continue to have the subtly of elementary TV time as soon as Lena walked into the military HQ in episode one, because what follows is the most ostentatious, in-your-face sequence of hamfisted social commentary I&rsquo;ve ever seen, and so far the show has yet to improve. Some of the plot devices are downright asinine, like characters being able to hear the cries of literal ghosts on the battlefield thanks to their magical bloodlines, and the characters themselves are just terrible. Shin is a fucking brick whose stock edgy trauma does little to deepen his character, the entire supporting cast is lucky if they get even a single piece of characterization you haven&rsquo;t seen a billion times in other highschool anime, and Lena spends most of the show a crying emotional mess with the strategy skills of a barely potty-trained toddler. Most women in uniform are dressed in otaku fetishwear with short skirts, boob windows, stockings, and garter belts, while all the men in uniform are wearing your average discount 1930s Hugo Boss uniforms. The 2D animation generally doesn&rsquo;t look as bad as you&rsquo;d expect from A1 Pictures, but it&rsquo;s still nothing special, and the drawings can still look about as shoddy and rushed as that of your average anime, so if you actually go out of your own way to scrutinize it thoroughly, you can find yourself some truly awful looking, off-model in-betweens. However, the backgrounds are exactly as bad as you&rsquo;d expect, the character designs are forgettable boilerplate trash when compared to the gorgeous LN cover art, and the CG&mdash;of which there is a fucking ton&mdash;is utterly abysmal. Every action scene in this show is a nightmarish fever dream of hideous CG mech monstrosities, disgusting digital particle effects, overbearing sound direction, and headache inducing visual direction, so Hiroyuki Sawano&rsquo;s music is nowhere near enough to distract me from the repulsive shit being smeared on screen before me. And all of this is being delivered, by the way, with multiple MONTHS of delays and recap episodes in between what I can only imagine is a hellish production crunch. No matter how juvenile its presentation may be, 86 does have a few worthwhile bits of personality, like how the soldiers used as fodder on the front lines refer to their Aryan overlords as &ldquo;white pigs,&rdquo; which is pretty funny, but these small, isolated sparks of life are no replacement for a well-written narrative.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI genuinely do not blame high schoolers or college kids for finding this kind of thing provocative, and while the horrendous action sequences might push some viewers away, I imagine the vast majority of the anime community will have nothing but good things to say about 86, and to them I have no harsh words. Please, enjoy it if you will. However, I also have to recognize that when you have a little perspective and are able to take a step back, it&rsquo;s impossible not see 86 as a completely generic melodrama with anime romcom trappings, teenage characters grappling with teenage identity issues, purely decorative themes, and your typical self-insert brooding gigachad protagonist surrounded by a selection of waifus for the audience, not whatever its fans tout it as.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for reading."}},{node:{id:32998,title:"91 Days",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/80515.jpg",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/80515l.jpg"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:6,num_episodes_watched:12,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2022-02-19T17:47:01+00:00",tags:["Not a bad crime thriller","but certainly way too ambitious for its own good.

After all, I&rsquo;ve only even read or watched one arc of Berserk&rsquo;s still unfinished story. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI&rsquo;m an anime fan, not a manga fan. I easily can turn this essay into a dissertation expounding this distinction and why I make it, but what&rsquo;s relevant to Berserk, no matter its renown as a manga and the ire its truest fans have for those projects which have tried their hand at adapting it, is the fact I&rsquo;m ultimately here for anime alone. As if this opinion wasn&rsquo;t unpopular enough, my favorite adaptation of Berserk is the film trilogy by Studio 4C, movies widely decried for their overuse of CG. The artwork of Kentar\u014d Miura is legendary and unmatched in more respects than one, and the idea of anyone, anywhere, with any means adapting his artwork faithfully to animation is a logistical impossibility. Is this an excuse for animators who attempt an adaptation and can&rsquo;t live up to the visual fidelity of the manga? No, and you could even argue for these very reasons Berserk is simply not meant to be adapted at all, but it is a reason why I&rsquo;m willing to open my mind to different artistic interpretations which, yes, skimp out on detail, but which are actually able to bring the manga to life on its own terms. Whether you prefer a borderline unanimated slideshow, yet one which boasts a gorgeous aesthetic birthed from the score of Susumu Hirasawa and the art design of Shichiro Kobayashi, like the 1997 adaptation, The Chronicle of Swords, or a completely animated yet fully 3DCG shitshow like the 2017 adaptation, these changes in art style are what allow manga like Berserk to get adapted, and personally, I prefer the hybrid approach.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI prefer The Golden Age Arc film trilogy, and while the compositing, shading, and frame rate control are as out of whack as any anime which heavily utilizes CG, they use the CG less as an excuse to not hand-draw certain cuts, and more as a means to give certain sequences a level of meticulous attention to detail which they couldn&rsquo;t have realistically had if done by hand. Moreover, when they completely hand-draw scenes which require such attention, they&rsquo;re nothing short of perfect. In particular, The Eclipse has all its most horrifically memorable scenes hand-drawn to cruel effect, earning the iconic imagery which the manga masterminded. Even if I agreed the never-ending still frames of The Chronicle of Swords was preferable to any of the fluid motions found in The Golden Age Trilogy, its animation was clunky whenever it was actually present, and such awkward movements and facial expressions absolutely ruined scenes like The Eclipse which require absolute perfection to fully realize. Either way, the only intellectually honest stance is this: the only difference between The Chronicle of Swords and the Golden Age Trilogy is how you cut corners and make cheap shit in the cel days versus how you do it now. Considering the fact they both butcher the manga&rsquo;s narrative structure in one way or another, it should become clear their problems are fundamentally identical. And while I could argue against the 2017 adaption as well, that garbage is among the anime industry&rsquo;s greatest sins, and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s disputed by anyone. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhere my defense stops, though, is exactly where most stop defending The Chronicle of Swords. The storytelling of Berserk can be, at times, daunting. This isn&rsquo;t a negative, at least not to someone like me who loves a juicy plot and an expansively planned setting, but to put everything into perspective, the Golden Age Arc spans twelve volumes of manga, twelve volumes which cannot be adapted fully over the course of a single cour, which is about the duration of The Golden Age Trilogy, or even two cours. Contrarian retroheads, anti-CG absolutists, and let&rsquo;s not mince words here, elitist assholes will always prefer the truncated narrative of The Chronicle of Swords more than the truncated narrative of The Golden Age Trilogy, but the fact remains to be seen by those with unbiased eyes, both adaptations offer an incomplete, unfaithful, and reengineered version of Berserk, so in my personal opinion which I&rsquo;ve already qualified as being massively unpopular, the truncated narrative of The Golden Age Trilogy is better told and better organized because unlike The Chronicle of Swords, who&rsquo;s narrative vacancies are accentuated by how transparently it attempted a full adaptation of the manga, The Golden Age Trilogy removed entire plot lines and character arcs. This focused the story, certainly, but more to my liking, it also presented it in a way which, at least as a standalone piece, felt complete and airtight as opposed to feeling like a story which could include only parts of everything from the source material.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, their production consistency is questionable, and despite feeling like a complete story, I know they aren&rsquo;t. As a fan, I know exactly which rich aspects of the world building were on the chopping block and exactly which of the endearing and engaging characters were relegated to background faces. As I began with, though, I&rsquo;m an anime fan, not a manga fan, so while all these issues and more can be solved by simply retreating back to the story&rsquo;s genuine article, the fact some of its adaptations have, in moments, outclassed even it itself leaves me admittedly listless as to which property deserves my loyal investment. Cases like Planetes have proven I&rsquo;m not always against placing manga above anime, just as cases like Koe no Katachi have proven the unruly metatext of an adaptation is sometimes enough to hold it down in light of its source material, but in this case, even that source material itself is incomplete. I mean, will suicidal old me really live long enough to see the ending of Berserk in my preferred medium of animation? Not only will I most certainly not, but comparing the uncontrollable rate at which I&rsquo;m self destructing to the meticulous and careful rate at which Miura is penning his masterpiece, there&rsquo;s a good chance I won&rsquo;t live long enough to see it even as a manga. And most of all, to finally address the elephant in the room which I&rsquo;ve avoided ever since hinting at it in the end of my introduction, I don&rsquo;t even know if the story beyond The Golden Age Arc is any damn good, because according to cynics, it isn&rsquo;t.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe sheer amount of anime I&rsquo;ve seen which is frankly unbelievable even to me in cooperation with my generally jaded and dejected attitude had me convinced no one outside the small list of living creatives who&rsquo;s mastery I already know well could produce a favorite ever again, and any and all favorites not already on my list were not anime yet to come, but among the few anime from the past which remained so obscure, even I had yet to find them. But in the Summer of 2017, I was proven to be so very wrong. Animated at a studio which branched off from Bones, of all people, based on a manga penned by some nobody character designer, and scored by a completely unheard of Australian composer was an anime I eventually came to call a masterpiece, one of my favorite anime of all time, and this happened to my utter disbelief, in the Summer of 2017. When its glorious airing concluded after the shortest single cour of my entire life, I was utterly terrified to see it go after having, for all intense and purposes, given me a rejuvenated reason to live, so in my desperation, despite the fact half of what made it such an excellent work of art was its impeccable animation, color design, voice acting, and heartbreakingly gorgeous music&mdash;none of which would be present in the manga&mdash;I sought out the source anyway. A stupid decision I regret, but one I learned from. Beginning right where the anime left off, I did the equivalent of gorging whatever was in the kitchen because my appetite was stoked by gourmet cuisine adverts on TV.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe narrative went in directions even more enthralling than in the anime, but the hollow feeling I felt from the lack of audio/visual splendor in comparison was so pinching, I could feel it even through my intoxication with the story. Every brilliant chapter after chapter I read served as a carrot on a stick, making me crawl further and further into a cavern I never should&rsquo;ve entered, and by the time my dumb ass had gotten the last bite off the hook and finally turned around to see what I&rsquo;d gotten myself into, I realized I was one step away from trivializing what had only just become a new favorite. I bring up this folly of mine because it&rsquo;s the cornerstone of my rationale regarding why I feel safer caring for the Berserk manga instead of the anime despite liking it less. The anime adaptation of Made in Abyss far outshines the manga, and, in some isolated fashions, The Golden Age Trilogy far outshines its manga all the same, so why does the Made in Abyss anime make My Favorites List while the Berserk anime doesn&rsquo;t, even though they&rsquo;re both based on manga which themselves are incomplete? Because I can trust the team behind the Made in Abyss anime to uphold that score. Berserk is such a perfect and delicate flower, anyone lacking a doctorate in botany will likely kill it with even the slightest mishandling, thus the only person I can trust with my heart is Miura himself, even if the few faithful adaptations of his masterpiece had moments which appeal to me far greater than the genuine article ever has and likely ever will.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for reading."}},{node:{id:12113,title:"Berserk: Ougon Jidai-hen II - Doldrey Kouryaku",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/37193.jpg",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/37193l.jpg"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:7,num_episodes_watched:1,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2021-08-09T06:59:47+00:00",tags:["My thoughts on this anime were too long for the tags.

Whether you prefer a borderline unanimated slideshow, yet one which boasts a gorgeous aesthetic birthed from the score of Susumu Hirasawa and the art design of Shichiro Kobayashi, like the 1997 adaptation, The Chronicle of Swords, or a completely animated yet fully 3DCG shitshow like the 2017 adaptation, these changes in art style are what allow manga like Berserk to get adapted, and personally, I prefer the hybrid approach.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI prefer The Golden Age Arc film trilogy, and while the compositing, shading, and frame rate control are as out of whack as any anime which heavily utilizes CG, they use the CG less as an excuse to not hand-draw certain cuts, and more as a means to give certain sequences a level of meticulous attention to detail which they couldn&rsquo;t have realistically had if done by hand. Moreover, when they completely hand-draw scenes which require such attention, they&rsquo;re nothing short of perfect. In particular, The Eclipse has all its most horrifically memorable scenes hand-drawn to cruel effect, earning the iconic imagery which the manga masterminded. Even if I agreed the never-ending still frames of The Chronicle of Swords was preferable to any of the fluid motions found in The Golden Age Trilogy, its animation was clunky whenever it was actually present, and such awkward movements and facial expressions absolutely ruined scenes like The Eclipse which require absolute perfection to fully realize. Either way, the only intellectually honest stance is this: the only difference between The Chronicle of Swords and the Golden Age Trilogy is how you cut corners and make cheap shit in the cel days versus how you do it now. Considering the fact they both butcher the manga&rsquo;s narrative structure in one way or another, it should become clear their problems are fundamentally identical. And while I could argue against the 2017 adaption as well, that garbage is among the anime industry&rsquo;s greatest sins, and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s disputed by anyone. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhere my defense stops, though, is exactly where most stop defending The Chronicle of Swords. The storytelling of Berserk can be, at times, daunting. This isn&rsquo;t a negative, at least not to someone like me who loves a juicy plot and an expansively planned setting, but to put everything into perspective, the Golden Age Arc spans twelve volumes of manga, twelve volumes which cannot be adapted fully over the course of a single cour, which is about the duration of The Golden Age Trilogy, or even two cours. Contrarian retroheads, anti-CG absolutists, and let&rsquo;s not mince words here, elitist assholes will always prefer the truncated narrative of The Chronicle of Swords more than the truncated narrative of The Golden Age Trilogy, but the fact remains to be seen by those with unbiased eyes, both adaptations offer an incomplete, unfaithful, and reengineered version of Berserk, so in my personal opinion which I&rsquo;ve already qualified as being massively unpopular, the truncated narrative of The Golden Age Trilogy is better told and better organized because unlike The Chronicle of Swords, who&rsquo;s narrative vacancies are accentuated by how transparently it attempted a full adaptation of the manga, The Golden Age Trilogy removed entire plot lines and character arcs. This focused the story, certainly, but more to my liking, it also presented it in a way which, at least as a standalone piece, felt complete and airtight as opposed to feeling like a story which could include only parts of everything from the source material.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, their production consistency is questionable, and despite feeling like a complete story, I know they aren&rsquo;t. As a fan, I know exactly which rich aspects of the world building were on the chopping block and exactly which of the endearing and engaging characters were relegated to background faces. As I began with, though, I&rsquo;m an anime fan, not a manga fan, so while all these issues and more can be solved by simply retreating back to the story&rsquo;s genuine article, the fact some of its adaptations have, in moments, outclassed even it itself leaves me admittedly listless as to which property deserves my loyal investment. Cases like Planetes have proven I&rsquo;m not always against placing manga above anime, just as cases like Koe no Katachi have proven the unruly metatext of an adaptation is sometimes enough to hold it down in light of its source material, but in this case, even that source material itself is incomplete. I mean, will suicidal old me really live long enough to see the ending of Berserk in my preferred medium of animation? Not only will I most certainly not, but comparing the uncontrollable rate at which I&rsquo;m self destructing to the meticulous and careful rate at which Miura is penning his masterpiece, there&rsquo;s a good chance I won&rsquo;t live long enough to see it even as a manga. And most of all, to finally address the elephant in the room which I&rsquo;ve avoided ever since hinting at it in the end of my introduction, I don&rsquo;t even know if the story beyond The Golden Age Arc is any damn good, because according to cynics, it isn&rsquo;t.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe sheer amount of anime I&rsquo;ve seen which is frankly unbelievable even to me in cooperation with my generally jaded and dejected attitude had me convinced no one outside the small list of living creatives who&rsquo;s mastery I already know well could produce a favorite ever again, and any and all favorites not already on my list were not anime yet to come, but among the few anime from the past which remained so obscure, even I had yet to find them. But in the Summer of 2017, I was proven to be so very wrong. Animated at a studio which branched off from Bones, of all people, based on a manga penned by some nobody character designer, and scored by a completely unheard of Australian composer was an anime I eventually came to call a masterpiece, one of my favorite anime of all time, and this happened to my utter disbelief, in the Summer of 2017. When its glorious airing concluded after the shortest single cour of my entire life, I was utterly terrified to see it go after having, for all intense and purposes, given me a rejuvenated reason to live, so in my desperation, despite the fact half of what made it such an excellent work of art was its impeccable animation, color design, voice acting, and heartbreakingly gorgeous music&mdash;none of which would be present in the manga&mdash;I sought out the source anyway. A stupid decision I regret, but one I learned from. Beginning right where the anime left off, I did the equivalent of gorging whatever was in the kitchen because my appetite was stoked by gourmet cuisine adverts on TV.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe narrative went in directions even more enthralling than in the anime, but the hollow feeling I felt from the lack of audio/visual splendor in comparison was so pinching, I could feel it even through my intoxication with the story. Every brilliant chapter after chapter I read served as a carrot on a stick, making me crawl further and further into a cavern I never should&rsquo;ve entered, and by the time my dumb ass had gotten the last bite off the hook and finally turned around to see what I&rsquo;d gotten myself into, I realized I was one step away from trivializing what had only just become a new favorite. I bring up this folly of mine because it&rsquo;s the cornerstone of my rationale regarding why I feel safer caring for the Berserk manga instead of the anime despite liking it less. The anime adaptation of Made in Abyss far outshines the manga, and, in some isolated fashions, The Golden Age Trilogy far outshines its manga all the same, so why does the Made in Abyss anime make My Favorites List while the Berserk anime doesn&rsquo;t, even though they&rsquo;re both based on manga which themselves are incomplete? Because I can trust the team behind the Made in Abyss anime to uphold that score. Berserk is such a perfect and delicate flower, anyone lacking a doctorate in botany will likely kill it with even the slightest mishandling, thus the only person I can trust with my heart is Miura himself, even if the few faithful adaptations of his masterpiece had moments which appeal to me far greater than the genuine article ever has and likely ever will.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for reading."}},{node:{id:12115,title:"Berserk: Ougon Jidai-hen III - Kourin",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/41305.jpg",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/41305l.jpg"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:7,num_episodes_watched:1,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2021-08-09T06:59:57+00:00",tags:["My thoughts on this anime were too long for the tags. Please click the More button to the left of the score to see the Comments for my thoughts."],comments:"EDIT: May 19th, 2021<br />\r\nThe Official Berserk Twitter just announced that, about two weeks ago, Kentar\u014d Miura passed away. I&rsquo;m not going to delete or change anything I&rsquo;ve written in the following piece, but given this sad reality, I promise I&#039;ll do my best to get motivated and read the manga up to the point he left it. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMay he rest in peace.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBerserk is beautiful, and as stated so poetically by Slan, so much so, it moves me to tears. Love; hate; agony; pleasure; life; death; everything is there. To repurpose the quote, Berserk shows what it means to be human, Berserk shows what it means to be demon. The depth of its human characters and the mature complexity in their realistic portrayal strongly reenforces the downright Shakespearian study on the human condition which Berserk sets out to be, and the challenging subject matters it proceeds to candidly discuss and ruthlessly depict are nothing short of awe inspiring. What it means to doubt your conviction or strive toward your ambition, pursue justice or strike at revenge, possess yourself with greed or blind yourself with passion. Berserk tackles fundamental questions such as these which humankind has been pondering for millennia with the tactful discussion and deft expression of a Greek philosopher, and it does so largely through subtext like any literary masterpiece should, maintaining a firm grip on its narrative instead of devolving into a lecture, yet boasting intellectual content most lectures only dream of. Most stories will find themselves utterly outclasses by the life changing chronicle that is Berserk, as it is a thesis on why fiction is and ever was powerful and valuable. I simply cannot praise it further without my prose coming across as hyperbole, or worse yet, my prose coming back to bite me in the ass. After all, I&rsquo;ve only even read or watched one arc of Berserk&rsquo;s still unfinished story. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI&rsquo;m an anime fan, not a manga fan. I easily can turn this essay into a dissertation expounding this distinction and why I make it, but what&rsquo;s relevant to Berserk, no matter its renown as a manga and the ire its truest fans have for those projects which have tried their hand at adapting it, is the fact I&rsquo;m ultimately here for anime alone. As if this opinion wasn&rsquo;t unpopular enough, my favorite adaptation of Berserk is the film trilogy by Studio 4C, movies widely decried for their overuse of CG. The artwork of Kentar\u014d Miura is legendary and unmatched in more respects than one, and the idea of anyone, anywhere, with any means adapting his artwork faithfully to animation is a logistical impossibility. Is this an excuse for animators who attempt an adaptation and can&rsquo;t live up to the visual fidelity of the manga? No, and you could even argue for these very reasons Berserk is simply not meant to be adapted at all, but it is a reason why I&rsquo;m willing to open my mind to different artistic interpretations which, yes, skimp out on detail, but which are actually able to bring the manga to life on its own terms.

Please click the More button to the left of the score to see the Comments for my thoughts."],comments:"BECAUSE OF MY RECENT PROFILE UPDATES, THIS PIECE IS NOW OUTDATED. IT WILL BE REVISED AND EDITED SOON.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMakoto Shinkai&mdash;especially since the release of his international hit, Your Name&mdash;has been more and more often compared to the most legendary director in anime history, Hayao Miyazaki. While many fitting him with this seemingly radically generous title are only casual viewers who know little of the industry&rsquo;s best (and who know even less about visual direction itself and whose opinions on the skill of a director are largely unlearned and hard to take seriously as review), the fact the comparison is being made in the first place says something about the man&rsquo;s influence and appeal. In response to such ubiquitous, heavy praise, the community&rsquo;s veterans have pushed back on this notion hard. Everyone with a keyboard, an opinion, and enough anime watched to have at least a few pretensions under their belts have mobilized against this notion like their lives and livelihoods depended on it, but all the while I couldn&rsquo;t help but side with the normies, even if not for their selfsame reasoning. You see, people are calling Shinkai the new Miyazaki not because they don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re talking about, but because he just is, and only those coming off a more detached appraisal can walk away with this conclusion. Quite frankly, the veteran anime fans are deluded, and they always have been. Remember, everyone was a casual at some point, and by ignorantly absorbing critical gospel and regurgitating it all the same and in presumably identical fashion as that which initially convinced them, they&rsquo;ve successfully fitted the incoming community members with an exact copy of their consensus&mdash;knowingly or otherwise&mdash;just as the previous generation did to them, despite the fact it wasn&rsquo;t from their own experience either.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI&rsquo;ve referenced what I now call the My Hero Academia Effect to no end on this page, though just like every other unapologetically self-coined and unexplained &ldquo;effect&rdquo; I call upon in my writings, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ve yet to actually detail what in the hell I mean by it. The My Hero Academia Effect is the excuse used by the masses to offer an anime functionally unanimous praise which is owed solely to the sense of validation they received from e-celebrities. When these kids, teens, and college kids hear someone they evaluate as being bigger than themselves call something great, they call it a masterpiece, and if they take root in the community without passing onto the next trend, these sentiments stay with them and metastasize throughout the forums, image boards, and aggregate sites holding the community together&mdash;permanently. While the chosen title to this effect is blatantly cynical in nature, the effect itself is by no means exclusively derogatory. Just as Mob Psycho 100, JoJo&rsquo;s Bizarre Adventure, and Dr Stone are platformed by the My Hero Academia Effect, so is Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, absolutely amazing anime which wholly deserve it. I feel the need to clarify the ambivalent implications of the My Hero Academia Effect, so I can proceed with this piece having made it crystal clear I&rsquo;m meaning it in the most negative connotation possible. If it&#039;s worth a mention, please know before I referenced the phenomena as the My Hero Academia Effect, I called it the Miyazaki Effect.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBe it the uncountably many plot holes, non sequitur characterization, utterly aimless direction, or banal theming of the pathetically edited adaptation that is Howl&rsquo;s Moving Castle; the grotesque animation, disgusting and at times even downright nauseating design work, terminally boring and never-ending chase sequence slogs of the tensionless, structureless mess that is Spirited Away; the offensively misguided messages, thoughtless conclusion, contrived-beyond-belief relationships, or ultimately contradictory moral lessons of the insult that is Kiki&rsquo;s Delivery&rsquo;s Service, a great deal of Miyazaki&rsquo;s catalog suffers detrimentally&mdash;or I suppose benefits dispiritingly, depending on how you look at it&mdash;from the My Hero Academia Effect, and those now carrying on that legacy are those who fell victim to it in the first place. This&mdash;and for no other reason&mdash;is why anime veterans deify Miyazaki and dismiss Shinkai, and while I agree categorically with the normies praising the latter, I feel this way not because I think he&rsquo;s as great as everyone&rsquo;s favorite reputation-not-talent based legend, Hayao Miyazaki, but because I think they&rsquo;re both bafflingly overrated, and the only reason the former gets the short end of the critical stick is because only one of them is overvalued. However, by my very own logic, someone had to start the trend of calling Miyazaki a genius for the farce that is his continued critical success to propagate in this manner, to which I&rsquo;d agree. The stuck-up, non-technically judgmental, cynically preaching, walking, talking stain that is the modern Miyazaki was once a genuine creative, and it&#039;s his work from such a time which began the cycle of praise, only for that modest snowball of cheer to roll into an unstoppable avalanche of worship.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBe it the infectiously delightful masterpiece of a family film that is My Neighbor Totoro and its irreplaceably iconic sense of wonder or the overflowing-with-personality period piece that is Porco Rosso and it&rsquo;s equally irreplaceable adult undertones on the personal effects humanism has to offer a troubled soul, Hayao Miyazaki has made some true inspirations in his early career, and it&#039;s these beauties in accompaniment with his other more standard fantasy epics which rightfully earned him his reputation in the past, and it&#039;s this reputation which people refused to reevaluate over time which lead him to the ivory tower of arrogance and complacency he now finds himself in. That said, such a time was, indeed, extent, and just as the cult of Miyazaki is comparable to the world&rsquo;s corrupted churches which all had their start in a true belief within the hearts of a faithful few, the mob of Shinkai fans have their origins seated not in all these Hollywood normie flicks, but in works ranging from fetish fantasies to a creator&rsquo;s lament of life itself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere have been no shortages of analysis highlighting these fixations, and I know everyone and their grandmother has already pointed it out to no end, but Five Centimeters Per Second is a distilled concentration of everything Shinkai has ever put to film, and it&#039;s because such a film was made so early in his career I think he was able to be so uncensored with the personal emotion the film is obviously imbued with&hellip;almost like how Marco and his plight of passion towards his piloting is a full-on mirror to Miyazaki and his plight of passion towards his work in the anime industry. Just like every other of Shinkai films&mdash;save the international hits, of course&mdash;Five Centimeters Per Second includes all the trains, all the women&rsquo;s feet, and all the flip phones in the world, but the major emotional obsession with a relationship doomed by distance now becomes the actual story of the film as opposed to a mere garnish. The fact all his complexes and intrigues make an appearance in all his films confirm an inescapably personal connection he must have to them, but taking that line of reasoning to its logical next step leads me to believe the story of Five Centimeters Per Second to be one not written from imagination merely directed by his usual wheelhouse of hang-ups, but an outright biopic of a chapter of his own life, a chapter which also certainly made him into the man he is today. I know it may seem like a cheap trick, or at the very least a manipulative manner of writing character emotion, but whether Five Centimeters Per Second can be called well written or not, it is irresistibly emotional because you just know the main guy IS Shinkai. The fact you know in your heart of hearts you&rsquo;re watching an appropriated version of a true chronicle makes it emotional inherently. An unbelievably melodramatically scripted character is one thing, but an unbelievably melodramatically scripted character you know is based on a real person overwrites the otherwise questionable writing despite&mdash;or maybe even in spite of your better judgement. I know no actual thinking human being&rsquo;s thoughts are internally narrated with such operatic poeticism in real life, but I also know no actual mechanic would be able to turn a profit running an all-woman team in interim world war Italy, and I accepted it none the less in Porco Rosso because I know it&#039;s a metaphor for Miyazaki having to begrudgingly accept a predominantly female workforce in the anime industry after the bubble burst despite his own admitted misogyny. Again, Shinkai is&mdash;whether you like it or not&mdash;the next Miyazaki, and just like the latter, Shinkai used to be able to make his works empathetically meaningful, even if he was never able to do so with the expert craft Miyazaki was. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFive Centimeters Per Second is among the few anime&mdash;or entertainment in general&mdash;which manages to be exceptionally valuable in contemplation whilst simultaneously being nearly torturous in experience. While the film is easily Makoto Shinkai&rsquo;s greatest directorial work, with the shot composition of the second act being downright iconic among most fans, it&#039;s just as easily among his most brain numbingly melodramatic. While the teenage emotional overload plays into the film&rsquo;s character, it kind of betrays the otherwise maturely framed presentation. Not that I&rsquo;m some genius filmmaker myself, but it he wanted to maintain the tone and make the point, he should&rsquo;ve Sky Crawlers&rsquo;d that ending shot. To me, Five Centimeters Per Second has much the same appeal and thematic value as Jin-Roh. Every teenager or college kid coming of age&mdash;and even no shortage of adults I&rsquo;ve met who&rsquo;ve yet to be dealt a bleak hand by life&mdash;need to see something like this very nearly was. A naively seated love story which ends with the heroine finding another man whilst the protagonist fritters his life away in hopes of her own promised return to him is exactly the kind of bleak reality check I love to see, but by having him accept the train reveal with a swift turn and knowing smile, his actions then downplay the hellishness of the situation at hand &amp; makes the melodrama all the more egregious in retrospect as the free pass that was the mature message fades away. By doing what The Sky Crawlers did, fading out on the shot unchanging, this story could&rsquo;ve been the masterpiece it was one change away from being by having him crushed into stillness upon the realization she didn&rsquo;t turn around to wait for him as he did for her&mdash;instead of having him for some reason contently spurned as a cuckold&mdash;this film would&rsquo;ve made the point as dismally as appropriate. In the end, having refrained from doing so, and probably with the main character&rsquo;s same knowing smile,  the thematic weight of Five Centimeters Per Second ends up relinquishing its potential as among the most ruthlessly realistic character pieces I&rsquo;ve ever seen and is just as soon outclassed by a single quote from Kiichi Gotou.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Yeah, everyone says that. They get dumped, and say, &lsquo;She&rsquo;s the only one for me. If I can&rsquo;t have her, I&rsquo;ll smash everything and then kill myself. And then she&rsquo;ll be sorry.&rsquo; But she won&rsquo;t be. A fool&rsquo;s death is buried on page three of the paper. The woman laughs and moves on to another man. Soon she&rsquo;s popping out the babies. She buys them bicycles, takes them to school, and out shopping. And the world goes on. It&#039;s tragic, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for reading."}},{node:{id:1657,title:"Byston Well Monogatari: Garzey no Tsubasa",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/5440.jpg",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/5440l.jpg"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:5,num_episodes_watched:3,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2022-02-19T23:03:16+00:00",tags:["No one with appreciation or respect for competent","professional acting & accurate translations would ever dare watch anime dubbed.

It&#039;s such torture to watch. It&#039;s not offensive, but that&#039;s why I can&#039;t finish it. It&#039;s just the most conventionally awful, boilerplate bad thing on Earth. As I said, this draft is very, very, very much unfinished, but I didn&#039;t want to just throw out this writing, so I figured I&#039;d just leave it here. It&#039;s still filled with all my notations and the like, but I&#039;m just going to leave everything as is. I guess you can see some of my drafting processes. And, you know, I just wanted to say it&#039;s funny. I didn&#039;t even drop the show for any reasons I got to in this draft. I dropped it because it&#039;s production values are ugly as sin. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDOC REV<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[int]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main character, Senku, counted seconds for three thousand seven hundred years and remained sane. Yeah&hellip;right&hellip;okay, this guy isn&rsquo;t a character anymore. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;But here, in this stone world, with nowhere to run, I wouldn&rsquo;t feel right as a man telling you. &hellip;Sorry! I&rsquo;m sure you have no idea what I&rsquo;m talking about&hellip;&rdquo; And when he pauses she turns to him to say in a normal volume of voice, &ldquo;No, I do.&rdquo; WHILE BLUSHING, SHE SAYS, &ldquo;NO, I DO.&rdquo; But alas, he continues, HER DIRECT ACKNOWLEDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING, &ldquo;We have to bring back civilization blah blah blah blah&hellip;&rdquo; and I immediately brought my fist down onto my unsuspecting thigh so hard my knee popped. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike, this big wannabe dramatic scene for a weak cliffhanger&rsquo;s sake at the end of episode four aired completely unanimated. You just hear a generic, stock sound effect of the guy getting slashed and get treated to two still images of the characters clicked and dragged past each other, and the episode unabashedly ends with that. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeing the alleged smart-boy show for kids teenagers, you&rsquo;d think the author would actually get his reading in, but you&rsquo;d be sorely mistaken, as there&rsquo;s endless plot holes which stem from the author clearly not knowing what the hell he was talking about. Just as a quick and particularly embarrassing example, remember that weak cliffhanger I mentioned earlier? Senku DOES actually die there, and the method used to resuscitate him is anatomically, biologically impossible. Tsukasa breaks his neck, and then once Dick Basket and his girlfriend escape with the body, they notice Senku still has some of the stone petrification left on the back of his neck. After recalling the loosely established fact the stone petrification can apparently heal the body underneath it upon removal, they apply the depetrification fluid and Senku comes back to life. Now, if you didn&rsquo;t know, when some guy snaps your neck, you don&rsquo;t actually die immediately, you just loose consciousness immediately and die shortly thereafter by related effects. The breaking of your vertebrae specifically severs the connection your brain has with the remainder of your body, and therefore forces it to lose control of all your basic, necessary bodily operations like breathing and circulation of your blood. You loose consciousness instantly because your nervous system is cut off, but what really ends up doing the deed is the lack of oxygen which comes along with the rest of your body taking a nap as well. The show tries to hand-wave this away by Taiju&mdash;forgot his name a second ago&mdash;attempting CPR on Senku briefly before they notice the bit of stone petrification, which would totally check out had it been applied intensively, correctly, and immediately, but Taiju only stops to perform this procedure after having mourned over the corpse for a minute, fought off Tsukasa, protected Yuzuriha from the explosion he set off in combat, ran down the entire cliff face, and continued running LITERALLY UNTIL THE WEATHER CHANGED. If you&rsquo;re telling me Senku could hold his breath for that long without suffocating you&rsquo;re clinically unstable, and I&rsquo;m seriously worried about you. And that&rsquo;s not even all there is to that asspull. The show has already forced us to buy into the idea Senku could count seconds for a bajillion years without going insane, just in case you forgot, so I&rsquo;m not worried about his mental state, but Senku would&rsquo;ve experienced a debilitating level of brain damage by oxygen deprivation after that long without circulation and should&rsquo;ve suffered extreme, extreme mental and nervous trauma from this. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd even with all circumstances and contexts aside, the plot holes penetrate down through the very building blocks of this horrendously flawed mess of a show. The petrified humans turned to stone are shown when broken to be entirely composed of said stone, but when people are freed from it, it&rsquo;s shown to be a mere encasement. Even if you were to excuse such a brazen, logic shattering visual contradiction, it also breaks the show&rsquo;s logic in writing. Remember, Senku and all these other losers kept themselves alive by staying consciously active while petrified, BUT HOW COULD YOU BE CONSCIOUSLY ACTIVE IF YOU&rsquo;RE&mdash;NOT TRAPPED UNDER A LAYER OF STONE&mdash;MADE OF STONE?!?!? News flash, your brain matter isn&rsquo;t made of rocks, so if your entire internal composition is turned to stone, you can&rsquo;t think. YOU&rsquo;RE DEAD!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe once edgelord who punched peoples heads off for dramatic effect suddenly decides not only to spare someone&rsquo;s life, but to put themselves in grave, fatal danger in the middle of combat to elaborately kick a tree down to miraculously (impossibly) crush them, also miraculously (impossibly) in a convenient location where their body wasn&rsquo;t harmed yet they also couldn&rsquo;t escape. The once edgelord who attempted to murder an unarmed and unresisting civilian then doesn&rsquo;t bother checking to see if they died and leaves them under the tree for our main guy to find and rescue. Why? Because she&rsquo;s a waifu on the show&rsquo;s cover. It&rsquo;s just that simple.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[prod]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGirls&rsquo; noses are in between their eyes and mouths are where their noses should&rsquo;ve been, and guys have hair straight out of an 80s parody OVA, only it doesn&rsquo;t fit given their blocky animation. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe kids and teenagers parading this show will pass this off as the original mangaka&rsquo;s unique art style&mdash;which is the case in part&mdash;but I invite you to just Google image search &ldquo;Dr Stone character designs&rdquo; and see for yourself. The animation staff seriously botched the artwork constantly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo why isn&rsquo;t this broken, annoying, sinfully ugly show not totally worthless? It&rsquo;s theming. I mean, the theming is summarizable by a sentence and none unable to count their age on their fingers should find it a revelation of any sorts, but I still must give credit where little credit is due. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n[theme]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHonestly, this review almost didn&rsquo;t happen. It almost couldn&rsquo;t happen. Following episode seven I just lost all steam and let this show go for weeks on end. An offensively, insurmountably bad show is easy to keep up with for it&rsquo;s pure sensationalism, but something like this, something so helplessly bad with no flair, just fills me with apathy. People I know of who I respect a great deal and whose taste I know to be highly, highly refined were praising this show almost every week, and while that surreal disconnect kept me intrigued for some time, it eventually faded as soon as I got my answer. These people&mdash;the entire community for that matter&mdash;are just better at indulging things than I am. They have the enviable, from where I&rsquo;m standing: magical, ability to indulge in something so wholly stupid with a carefree shrug and a free spirited remark, &ldquo;Yeah, but that&rsquo;s the kind of stupid I like!&rdquo; This is not the kind of stupid I like, nor am I young or happy enough to like ANY kind of stupid unless it&rsquo;s layered with meaning so deep the farcical exterior doesn&rsquo;t even matter, and while Dr. Stone certainly has some meaning&mdash;no matter how elementary&mdash;it&rsquo;s impossible to feel when even that level of theme relies on logic the story broke from the outset.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for reading."}},{node:{id:223,title:"Dragon Ball",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1887/92364.jpg",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1887/92364l.jpg"}},list_status:{status:"dropped",score:2,num_episodes_watched:13,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2017-08-27T01:31:21+00:00",tags:[],comments:""}},{node:{id:813,title:"Dragon Ball Z",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1277/142022.webp",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1277/142022l.webp"}},list_status:{status:"dropped",score:2,num_episodes_watched:4,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2018-01-17T02:05:27+00:00",tags:[],comments:""}},{node:{id:9330,title:"Dragon Crisis!",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/50311.webp",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/50311l.webp"}},list_status:{status:"dropped",score:2,num_episodes_watched:1,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2018-12-06T20:01:13+00:00",tags:[],comments:""}},{node:{id:296,title:"Dragon Drive",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1/2214.webp",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1/2214l.webp"}},list_status:{status:"dropped",score:4,num_episodes_watched:3,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2022-02-20T23:34:07+00:00",tags:["It's not terrible","but it's just any other boring shounen."],comments:""}},{node:{id:870,title:"Dragon Half",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1558/97694.jpg",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1558/97694l.jpg"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:5,num_episodes_watched:2,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2022-02-19T22:45:59+00:00",tags:["Visually delightful","infectiously entering","& hilariously referential","even if I've never really been that into games","let alone the ones this series is parodying.

Please click the More button to the left of the score to see the Comments for my thoughts."],comments:"BECAUSE OF MY RECENT PROFILE UPDATES, THIS PIECE IS NOW OUTDATED. IT WILL BE REVISED AND EDITED SOON.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis post is a journey, greatly edited and cut down, but a journey nonetheless.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLately, I&rsquo;ve developed a bit of a complex. While my bulimia/anorexia cycles through bimonthly, my suicidal tendencies take anywhere from eleven to thirteen months. I think it has something to do with the fact I need time to convince myself I&rsquo;m actually capable of jumping, that is, to forget I&rsquo;ve proven myself to&rsquo;ve been incapable of taking the last step many times over and need to go a while between attempts to forget the last and develop fear for the next, but going into detail on this is a whole other rant. The point is when I get close to the end of one of these cycles I start getting irresponsible, using the idea any consequences warranted for my actions soon won&rsquo;t matter for I&rsquo;ll be dead as an excuse to do so. Even though there&rsquo;s no point to it all, I take pride in the fact I can still function with my depression. Despite hating every second of every day and never seeing any reward for my painstaking effort leaving life feeling progressively more meaningless as the years go by, I still do a great job of wearing a proper exterior. Everyone can see my wrists, as I see them staring, but seeing as I&rsquo;ve been cutting since I was in high school and have yet to have a single person comment on them, I think its fair to say most people just want to let sleeping dogs lie and take my facade at face value&mdash;which is something I&rsquo;m grateful for. But I keep getting off track. In my last spurt of irresponsibility, I decided to stop taking my sleeping pills and spend my nights rewatching shows I haven&rsquo;t seen in forever since I&rsquo;ve effectively run out of anime to watch. Since I was in that kind of mood, Ergo Proxy came to mind, as it is one of my least favorite anime of all time, and if you were to disqualify the shows I hate for moral reasons like Welcome to the NHK, Kuuchuu Buranko, or the Colorful film, Ergo Proxy might just be number one. While I&rsquo;ve only seen it once back in school on the good old FUNimation Network, I still hated it despite it being one of the first anime I ever saw. Back then I had no standards or knowledge of what makes anime or really&nbsp;anything&nbsp;good, yet I still remember viscerally hating Ergo Proxy. My main complaints being it was boring and made no sense whatsoever. The boring part was obviously just me being a stupid teenager who, if transported to this time, would probably be eating up My Hero Academia and Mob Psycho 100 with the rest of the kids, but the part about it making no sense was something I felt to be somewhat objective and something which would age well if I had to defend it to this day.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhich I have, with purpose. I&rsquo;ve defended my stance on Ergo Proxy, not because it was a well informed stance to take or at all concurrent, but because I&rsquo;ve seen nothing to convince me otherwise. All those years ago when I was first taking an interest in anime, I hated a lot of good shows because, again, I was just a dumb teenager. I thought Ghost in the Shell was boring. I thought FLCL was pointless and annoying. I thought K-On! was for children. I had so many stupid opinions on things which, as I grew up, I realized to be silly and sought to change or at least update. However, nothing about Ergo Proxy ever even in the slightest bit compelled me to give it another shot. People who generally share my opinions vocally hated it for the exact same reasons I did, and everything which I had seen or re-seen of the show upheld my opinions. It&rsquo;s production values are either turned up to eleven capitalizing on Shuko Murase&rsquo;s immense directorial talent completely or locked in a solid four out of ten and failing to even stay on model or even hand drawn, it&rsquo;s philosophical references do little other than make it seem pretentious, and it&rsquo;s pacing is as brain numbingly plodding as Monster&hellip;but wait. Is it? Aside from the inconsistent quality of animation, am I really able to confidently confirm any of what I just said without having rewatched it properly? Was it smart to take others&rsquo; words for it?&nbsp;Do I really hate Ergo Proxy? These are the questions I started seriously asking after that night I began a rewatch.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI had already spent over two and a half weeks off my medication, and I&rsquo;d done a lot with my time. I rewatched Paranoia Agent (for the third time) and Infinite Ryvius, but then I strayed off the path of rewatching and got around to watching Log Horizon Season Two and loved it, and I even did the unthinkable getting into long form franchises which I&rsquo;d given up on ever watching with the limited time I have as a grown up. All the Gundam I watched, all the Lupin III I watched, and all the Precure I watched were all made possible by these free nights and had me feeling amazing. Luckily, it didn&rsquo;t take me long to realize I was getting off track. The point of going insomniac was to drown myself in anime which fostered my depression enough to push me over the edge. Paranoia Agent and especially Infinite Ryvius did their jobs, but then I had to go and watch uplifting things. To get back down to brass tacks, I figured I&rsquo;d punish myself by watching something I hated, and Ergo Proxy was the first thing which came to mind.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI watched four episodes, and I probably would&rsquo;ve watched more if not for the sun rising and leaving me with no choice. After another meaningless day, I was back to my normal self by night and didn&rsquo;t even have the drive to continue my punishment watching and threw on Precure again. Time passed, got to the end of my cycle, went to the parking garage, stood on the edge for hours crying, purging, and for the first time cutting myself in what was effectively a public place&mdash;even if in the middle of the night and without a soul in sight&mdash;and as usual, didn&rsquo;t jump and had to stumble past the poor twenty year old receptionist in my building with my arm covered in blood. Today I remembered I&rsquo;d watched four episodes of Ergo Proxy, and its kind of freaking me out. I think I liked it. Even in these first few episodes the inconsistency couldn&rsquo;t be more apparent, and while the production was never something I&rsquo;d call outright bad, the lack of detail from a distance and the egregious early 3DCG usage was more than a bit much. However, putting the technicals aside and focusing on the actual intellectual content of the show, I&rsquo;d go so far as saying I enjoyed it. Murase&rsquo;s direction is seriously better than Genocidal Organ if only when Manglobe puts their full animation attention behind it, the somewhat formulaic setting is elevated by the great color design and setting mapping, and the character writing in particular is great. Vincent is entrancingly enigmatic bringing amazing visual tone shifts, Iggy is a great source of world building in general and character building for Re-l, Pino is an absolute treasure and almost certainly the inspiration for Ringo from Casshern Sins, and while Raul and Daedalus are already showing themselves to be at least somewhat thought-out character personalities, Re-l has already built herself totally and is super relatable for me personally. She&rsquo;s disagreeable and cynical but not immature about it, and while she&rsquo;s enough of an adult to know how to use her sexuality as a weapon of manipulation, for example, she&rsquo;s also enough of an edgy post-teen to have spunk and life to her personality. The more I type the more unsettled I feel. I repeat,&nbsp;do I really hate Ergo Proxy?&nbsp;Sure, much of my gripes were probably a product of my own shortcomings as a viewer unwilling to put in effort on my side of the screen, but at the very least I know the ending made no sense, right? I know it made no sense.&nbsp;I know it made no sense.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t remember anything which happened explicitly, but in the vaults of my long term memory not yet annihilated by my metric tons of neurological prescription drugs, I still vividly recall this one frame of Vincent, as the Proxy, standing on the edge of the dome smirking, starring directly at the camera with the sun rising behind him, and myself feeling pissed off. No matter what I think I remember, the paranoia won&rsquo;t leave until I confirm it myself. I&rsquo;ll finish this post after the rewatch. Wish me luck.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlright, so I&rsquo;m sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this post is going to end up feeling super anticlimactic. I had approached this with only two outcomes in prediction. The first and most likely outcome was me rewatching it with the infinitely more critical eyes I now wear and come back hating it even more, delving into utter madness plastering screams onto my keyboard somehow passing them through the internet only to come blaring out the speakers of any reader, and the second being the total opposite, seeing a blatant masterpiece I only missed out on the first time around for my lack of awareness and aptitude towards critical thinking. Never did I expect anything in between, which is just about what I got.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI think I&rsquo;m going to settle on a solid Four.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYes, a Four was uncontestedly the most unexpected outcome in context, but its also the hardest score to get per My Rating System by leaps and bounds even in general. I&rsquo;ll take any excuse you give me to give a show a Two, and only the most perfectly calculated train wrecks can manage to be technically bad yet still in my favor. However, Ergo Proxy managed. To begin, I&rsquo;ll say as predicted, some of the parts of the show which I remembered hating the most ended up being far and away my favorite things about it. The tone and feel was utterly intoxicating and totally on my wavelength in every way. Be it the cyberpunk setting, film noir color palette and design work, sleek and gothic character designs, gorgeous chiming soundtrack, or the impeccably detailed sound design, I was totally sold on the entire audio/visual presentation of the show, even while considering it&rsquo;s stark production inconsistency I already knew was coming and which remained prevalent, if not worsened, throughout the whole runtime after the four episodes I had recently watched. The Monad Proxy&rsquo;s awakening or it&rsquo;s rampaging massacre through the mall, Vincent&rsquo;s elimination of Cogito infected Autoraves with the awesomely designed and lavishly animated exoskeletons in tow, Re-l&rsquo;s initial encounter with the Monad Proxy ambushing from above, or the legendary bathroom scene with Re-l&rsquo;s first enchanting meeting with the Ergo Proxy, there are such a vast myriad of scenes which&rsquo;ll surely go down in my anime history as favorites as standalone scenes go. And its here I&rsquo;d like to make an analogy I realized around halfway through my rewatch. Never in a hundred million years did I expect this post or my opinions to turn out this way or even go in this general direction, but I seriously think I&rsquo;ll remember this anime in the long run in much the same way I do Guilty Crown.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI mean, I straight up loved it. I&rsquo;m kind of at a loss for words. Like Guilty Crown, it&rsquo;s script is it&rsquo;s failing, with loose and inconsistent character writing, pacing issues and awkward sub-arcs, and obviously the elephant in the room for both shows being plot holes galore which increase at an exponentially soaring rate the closer to the finale you get, but also like Guilty Crown, it&rsquo;s visual presentation is made for me for all the reasons I tossed around earlier. Yeah, Guilty Crown is a Production IG show and doesn&rsquo;t share the same ridiculous inconsistency in animation Ergo Proxy holds, but since I&rsquo;d go so far as to say Ergo Proxy reaches higher highs than Guilty Crown reaches, it&rsquo;s lower lows don&rsquo;t bother me as much as you&rsquo;d think. And, yes, I do commit to that statement. I&rsquo;m not just throwing around pretty words for the sake of prose. I genuinely think Ergo Proxy reaches creative visual heights which Guilty Crown, the legendary visual spectacle which I&rsquo;ve constantly paraded as the foundation for my love of acclaimed director Tetsuro Araki, ever reaches, and it even does so in such a way which may also take Guilty Crown&rsquo;s first place gold medal in the race of rank-defining Fours I sincerely wish I could make Tens: a shame of a story which internally goes to hell the further it tells itself whilst remaining unmatched in it&rsquo;s external appeal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe point of Too Long For The Tags was to detail my unique outlook, so I don&rsquo;t want to devolve into a glorified review of the show which&rsquo;ll inevitably boil down to the score I already said I&rsquo;d give, but there is one thing I&rsquo;d like to mention before closing. The reason I feel okay being remiss about letting this show go is because it wasn&rsquo;t really about anything. Of my vague remembrances I had been able to recollect before this rewatch&mdash;obviously aside from my seemingly endless gripes&mdash;the one thing I remember being positive about, or at the very least what I found the slightest bit interesting, was it&rsquo;s themes. I remember the value in preaching a story which incorporated something like the Cogito Virus, even if it was a message told better, more academically, more maturely, and outright more entertainingly by Ghost in the Shell: Innocence, and on top of these themes in writing, the presentation which strongly supported it was stellar even in my overly critical memories. The shot of Pino praying for her surrogate Mother and Younger Brother in the mall chase stuck in my memory as powerful even through all the years since my viewing it, and there were many conversations where I would acknowledge the show&rsquo;s effort on that front readily. On top of all this, the thing which truly solidified Ergo Proxy in my mind as a smart and meaningful series&mdash;or at least a series which was supposed to be smart and meaningful&mdash;was reading others talks about it. I know that&rsquo;s a pretty hollow thing to say, but I&rsquo;m a pretty hollow person. In all those pretentious 3x3 threads on /a/, every time someone praised the life changing masterpiece that is Texhnolyze, there&rsquo;d always be at least one guy to say Ergo Proxy was better. Even though I never knew the basis to this incessant comparison, I eventually accepted the assumption they were shows cut from the same thematic cloth, and holy hell was that a stupid assumption to make!? Again, after watching it through and through, Ergo Proxy isn&rsquo;t really about anything. For all it&rsquo;s visual symbolism and seriously well read philosophical and literary references, including even the Cogito Virus and it&rsquo;s implications, never did it actually make any assertions about a single one of the ideas it brought up. And that&rsquo;s not an insult, because I wouldn&rsquo;t even say it&nbsp;tried&nbsp;to. Reading through interviews with Murase doesn&rsquo;t read like interviews with Mamoru Oshii or Masaaki Yuasa, they read like interviews with Hiroyuki Imaishi or Tetsuro Araki. All the visual splendor the show throws around are suggested to be just that: eye candy. He and the series&#039; writer Sato Dai seem to maintain Ergo Proxy was purely an aesthetic venture they embarked on for the sole reason of making something they could say looked cool. Nothing more, nothing less.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe text opener of the show, a quote from Michelangelo Buonarroti, in case you don&rsquo;t remember, is as follows:<br />\r\n-Welcome is sleep, more welcome sleep of stone<br />\r\n-Whist crime and shame continue in the land;<br />\r\n-My happy fortune, not to see or hear;<br />\r\n-Awake me not; Hush, whisper low.<br />\r\nFrom a philosophical standpoint, the quote is an obvious lament of humankind&rsquo;s painfully endless indulgence of vice and the listlessness of a man unwilling to concern himself with the harsh realities and irredeemable acts surrounding him who simply yearns for rest in blissful ignorance. On the other hand, from a cynical perspective, the quote can most loosely be interpreted as one simply saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo; To unabashedly state, even while acknowledging all enticing visual symbols, even while acknowledging all exciting new ideas, even while acknowledging all prospective physiological suggestions, even while acknowledging all potentially bountiful thematic wealth springs, I don&rsquo;t care. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Fellow Citizens, life is easier when you lighten your load.&quot; Apparently, of thought.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for reading."}},{node:{id:32901,title:"Eromanga-sensei",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/86468.webp",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/86468l.webp"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:1,num_episodes_watched:12,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2021-09-19T13:23:04+00:00",tags:["It really sickens me this is the face of popular anime & people think it\u2019s okay to celebrate something this vapid & cynical.

Please click the More button to the left of the score to see the Comments for my thoughts."],comments:"I promise I&rsquo;ll keep this one relatively short.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll the Project Itoh films, and I say this not having read any of the novels on which they&rsquo;re based, are messy at best and awful at worst. I&rsquo;m sorry, but Ryoutarou Makihara just isn&rsquo;t a good director, and assuming the novel is even any good to begin with, The Empire of Corpses was doomed from the start with him leading the project. Questionable CG integration notwithstanding, the film&rsquo;s gorgeous artwork and animation is as expected from WIT Studio, but its visual direction is nonetheless more lifeless than its cardboard characters, and the thematic discussion it entertains fails to meet every expectation. The studio and creative staff which adapted Harmony, on the other hand, was much more suited to something of this nature. However, excessive and ugly CG aside, the writing still falls short, and not in the directionless, obviously-poorly-adapted way in which The Empire of Corpses did. It&rsquo;s badly written in a fundamental sense; the novel was clearly flawed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGenocidal Organ is at first easy to praise. My love and adoration for Shukou Murase is something I hope is well known, and this film boasts all which makes him such an excellent director. Its sleek noir aesthetics are to die for, and the unique animation techniques used to produce it fits his character designs like a glove. I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit: Manglobe going bankrupt mid-production is clear as day, and the differing levels of animation quality on display throughout the film is of course noticeable to anyone with my&mdash;for lack of a better term&mdash;experience. Be that as it may, though, I still think the film is ultimately beautiful on the strength of its cinematography, art design, and color design, and its fascinating military future-tech was depicted as brilliantly as its fridge horror elements were made for Murase: from the murder of drugged-up child soldiers to the helicopter crash where the numbed operatives on stimulants continue to fight after being blown in half.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNevertheless, much like its Project Itoh counterparts, Genocidal Organ remains thematically half-baked. Its message comes so close to profundity, but to anyone educated in the history of the twentieth century, it&rsquo;s impossible to go along with what the film is ultimately trying to say. This notion that peace in the West is dependent on manufactured chaos in other parts of the world is rooted in Eisenhower&rsquo;s &ldquo;military-industrial complex,&rdquo; which does, indeed, exist, but the author has a grave lack of post-WW2 economic understanding. To put it in a single phrase, the film is reductionist. The United States&rsquo; military-industrial complex has definitely been profitable for certain parties, but considering the subsidization essential to its existence, it hardly even pays for ITSELF, let alone the entire wealth of the nation. Proxy wars fuel the industries of war in times of peace, but to even suggest they alone are what&rsquo;s supporting the entire Western economy is daft.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere&#039;s a part of our brains which helps us learn and understand language from a young age evidenced by the fact different languages across the world have consistent grammar rules, prepositions, etc. What the movie calls the &ldquo;Genocidal Organ&rdquo; is this part of the brain, only now as a sci-fi concept. Through his analysis of language, John Paul discovered certain patterns of speech used by the media and the general population right before a genocide, and he uses this knowledge to incite genocides around the world. The peace America enjoys is built upon the suffering of other nations, and in order to maintain this security, the citizens have to relinquish their right to privacy to maintain the surveillance state keeping them all safe. Clavis realizes all this when John Paul explains his program, and at the end of the movie, he uses his military trail as a platform to tell the citizens of America the truth, whether or not the outcome is good or bad. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon&rsquo;t get me wrong. I like how the film explores these issues and more: like how peace breeds complacency, how electronic money is used as a mechanism of surveillance, how global superpowers have complete influence over international conflict in the third world, and so on. In fact, the &quot;I just wanna eat McDonald&#039;s&quot; line everyone stupidly makes fun of is not only legitimately powerful, but it lays bare the thematic heart and soul of the film. Some people just don&#039;t care. They just want to be able to eat half a pizza and throw the rest away. They want that level of level of security and comfort, even if it&#039;s knowingly achieved at the expense of others. There really is a lot to think about in this movie, but when you juxtapose these otherwise savory and thoughtful ideas with the misguided notions their predicated on, the whole thing is hard to take seriously intellectually. And this isn&rsquo;t even mentioning some of the more hokey shit the film has to offer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI&rsquo;m not going to spend a lot of time on this, I did promise to be brief after all, but it&rsquo;s worth mentioning this film isn&rsquo;t always as grounded as it needed to be. The scene where Clavis first meets John Paul and he discombobulates him with his words is just dumb. You and I, the audience, are hearing what John Paul is saying just as clearly as Clavis, yet we&rsquo;re unaffected. This is a movie, it&rsquo;s fiction, but when the entire worth of the story is its alleged ability to serve as real-world commentary, and yet it has fourth-wall-breaking moments like this which accentuate its unreality, it can hardly be called a success. Again, there&rsquo;s more to nitpick, but I&rsquo;ve already said more than I planned to. Genocidal Organ is really good, and the novel has an international release available for purchase, so I may go and get to reading, but it ultimately lacks the historical knowledge and worldly perspective something this delicate needs to convincingly say what it&rsquo;s trying to say.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for reading."}},{node:{id:31630,title:'Gyakuten Saiban: Sono "Shinjitsu", Igi Ari!',main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/79448.jpg",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/79448l.jpg"}},list_status:{status:"dropped",score:2,num_episodes_watched:1,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2018-12-06T18:24:23+00:00",tags:[],comments:""}},{node:{id:10417,title:"Gyo",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/31905.jpg",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/31905l.jpg"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:2,num_episodes_watched:1,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2020-11-16T05:06:48+00:00",tags:[],comments:""}},{node:{id:3299,title:"H2O: Footprints in the Sand",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1762/133884.webp",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1762/133884l.webp"}},list_status:{status:"dropped",score:2,num_episodes_watched:1,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2019-03-18T00:26:26+00:00",tags:[],comments:""}},{node:{id:38830,title:"Hachi-nan tte, Sore wa Nai deshou!",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1834/110718.webp",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1834/110718l.webp"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:2,num_episodes_watched:12,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2020-07-14T02:54:33+00:00",tags:[],comments:""}},{node:{id:38091,title:"Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1824/100449.jpg",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1824/100449l.jpg"}},list_status:{status:"dropped",score:2,num_episodes_watched:1,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2019-04-07T22:45:47+00:00",tags:[],comments:""}},{node:{id:16,title:"Hachimitsu to Clover",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1301/133577.webp",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1301/133577l.webp"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:6,num_episodes_watched:24,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2022-01-01T18:31:47+00:00",tags:["This was a self-help book I didn't need to read","& I consider myself a fan of Umino Chika.

To exclaim, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe people like this,&rdquo; is really to maliciously, passive aggressively imply, &ldquo;People really should not like this.&rdquo; Be it liking Naruto and Bleach for your nostalgia or liking My Hero Academia and Mob Psycho 100 because e-celebrities told you to, every anime who&rsquo;s popularity I find to be &ldquo;baffling&rdquo; has one or two&mdash;maybe not good, but&mdash;valid and easily discernible reasons for earning the adoration of the audience it has. While this phenomenon goes both ways, given how often I find myself whining and wondering why some shows don&rsquo;t have praise and recognition I feel they should, this is almost exclusively due to a show&rsquo;s sheer lack of exposure. It&#039;s not people calling a good show bad; it&rsquo;s just people not praising a show because they simply aren&rsquo;t aware of its existence. Rarely do I witness the actual opposite effect, people collectively bashing an anime they all know of which deserves to be celebrated, and on top of that, even when this does happen in earnest, it&#039;s only by a small and obtusely vocal minority who are hating on something for a silly reason and making more of a fool out of themselves than the anime in question, be it a fandom grudge like that against Nisekoi, mass contrarianism like that regarding Psycho-Pass, an e-celebrity&rsquo;s radical followers like those after A Place Further Than the Universe, or the community at large outright not understanding it like Paranoia Agent. Eden of the East, though, is the first real example of the community as a whole seeming to be in total agreement, with great conviction, a good show is bad.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeeing as the statement I&rsquo;m about to discuss is so put-on, after having witnessed it used in public discourse once, I immediately sought to find out who first said it, as there was simply no way in hell it was a consensus opinion naturally birthed out of the either, and while I predictably found it propagated by two YouTube personalities by the names Glass Reflection and Digibro, I&rsquo;m still fascinated by how taken the community became with a misapprehension so utterly misguided. &ldquo;It has a criminally unsatisfying ending.&rdquo; This statement, at least in my own experience, has perforated every critical discussion of Eden of the East since the dawn of its finale, and I think it paints a much larger picture of the mass misunderstanding of this show than most of the people brainlessly regurgitating it may realize. All these normies oblivious to deeper theming, casuals unwilling to empathize with a story they don&rsquo;t resonate with directly, and immature kids, teens, and college kids call the ending a let-down, but should you be a NEET among the show&rsquo;s respectably minuscule target audience, it&#039;s quite the opposite. When you see Tetsuya Nishio and Takashi Hashimoto&rsquo;s jaw dropping display of those missiles getting shot down whist Reveal the World is playing over Masayuki Yoshihara&rsquo;s iconic episode direction, you think, wow, losers like me really can be something. Following my first viewing of that utterly sublime scene, at least after I was finished wiping the tears off my face and blowing my nose, I was honestly shocked to find this eleven episode gem had a sequel. It was like I&rsquo;d only just remembered the show had a plot, a very interesting plot which served as the vehicle for all the priceless theming and characterization which made the show a masterpiece in the first place, but a plot which nevertheless took a backseat for their sake and which did not need to wrap up to do what the show set out to do at heart. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nActually, Eden of the East, the TV anime, was only recently allowed on My Favorites List. Prior to then, I had my list set up such that for an anime to be listed, all entries in its canon had to also have made the list so they could be listed in a group. Stupid, I know, which is why I changed it, hoping it would allow more outstanding works in a series to gain the recognition they deserved, leaving behind their less exceptional installments. Just as planned, Eden of the East, finally unrestrained by the questionable quality of its sequel films who&rsquo;d long since held it down, found itself near the summit of My Favorites List where it always belonged. However, some anime to whom this change was meant to benefit didn&rsquo;t get the same treatment, and these unfortunate exceptions really helped me understand the actual ramifications of the changes to my list I myself made. Mobile Police Patlabor and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni are great examples to cherry pick which best exemplify this phenomenon, because the former is the only anime which benefited from the changes to my list even more than Eden of the East, and the latter is the only anime which didn&rsquo;t manage to benefit from the changes at all. Mobile Police Patlabor is a case of two films animated by Production IG, the greatest animation studio in the world, directed by Mamoru Oshii, in my opinion the best director in the world, and written by Kazunori Ito, one of the most brilliant writers in the industry, which were held down by their associated OVAs, TV anime, and atrocious sequel film which I could never force myself to add to My Favorites List in accordance with the retarded rules I built it with, so while this is a dramatic instance, I still found myself unable to raise up other shows I adored, such as Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, which shouldn&rsquo;t have kept their scores of less than or equal to Six without their inferior prequels, sequels, or spin-offs holding them down any longer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnbeknownst to me, what I failed to factor in was the inability of outstanding installments to an inconsistent series to reap the benefits of the changes when they may or may not have actually been able to stand on their own two feet as complete and effectively self-contained stories, and while, yes, you can nitpick elements of the aforementioned examples like the fact you wouldn&rsquo;t have known Kanuka Clancy had you not seen the original Mobile Police Patlabor OVAs, the minuscule details which the entries off the list take with them are nowhere near enough to drag the entries on the list back off because&mdash;and this is the important part&mdash;those aren&rsquo;t what made me care about what of the series I do to begin with. To me, the principle value in Mobile Police Patlabor is its outstanding writing, intricate narrative planning, contemplative theming, and mature characterization (at least in the hyper-realistic films), so removing an element as trivial as a side character&#039;s introduction does not take away from the work in that sense. But with a more visceral work who&rsquo;s appeal is more primal, like Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, this mold is broken by the fact something more experiential requires a payoff more tangible. What makes season one of that show so addicting is all its twists and turns which it weaves throughout its world which itself is so well built, you become seriously immersed despite its nearly ostentatious thrill and excessive tonal stylization. Therefore, the contrived and bloodless conclusion to the second season which utterly disrespects the cutthroat stakes and brutal consequences the series had worked so hard to establish robs it of that capacity for immersion and serves to invalidate the worth of the entire series. The fact the final arc&mdash;which itself is the singular narrative thru-line to the plot as a whole&mdash;is utterly squandered by such a death of tone, makes the entire show feel like a waste of time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEden of the East is not like this. The storyline of the TV anime is so incredibly smart in writing and meaningful on concept, and while its ending is certainly riddled with loose-ends, it&rsquo;s unfinished, so what of the plot the show afforded itself time to unravel is what&rsquo;s open to fair critique, and there are no plot holes with which to do so yet. Both as an ensemble cast and as individual personalities, the Sele&ccedil;&atilde;o are increasingly rife with the contemplative theming and clever sociopolitical commentary which makes Kenji Kamiyama the unequivocal genius he is, and they are so in a manner so timely and important to the empathetic, sympathetic, humanistic characters which the series has already made you love and care for, and to the world outside the screen which its messages dissect and which its implications commentate on, that by the end of the show you&rsquo;ve completely forgotten about the actual machinations of Mister Outside, The Supporter, or the established villains abusing the game in the absence of its maker. I mean, look at it this way, Sele&ccedil;&atilde;o Number Five, Doctor Hajime Hiura, is a man who&rsquo;s reading of the phrase &ldquo;Save Japan,&rdquo; a directive who&rsquo;s purposely interpretive nature couldn&rsquo;t be more thoughtful, was to remedy the pressing issue of the country&rsquo;s rapidly growing elderly population who&rsquo;s retirement funds can no longer pay for increasingly expensive healthcare and assisted living facilities. To realize this imperative goal, Doctor Hiura uses funds which he already owned as the superintendent and corporate owner of a hospital district to expand and renovate the geriatric wards, essentially annexing a retirement home, and then hiring his elderly patients en mass, providing the same white collar desk jobs they used to work, only now with housing and direct care as benefits. Not only does this built a legitimate community, but it solves the issue at hand by overcoming the issue most businesses have with keeping their elderly employees employed, healthcare and insurance, by having them literally work whilst in care. As if this wasn&rsquo;t a statement of socioeconomic renaissance on its own rights, what makes this idea for a character even more intelligent is the fact Doctor Hiura only needed to use his ten billion yen from Juiz to influence the shortsighted labor laws which were keeping him from doing this a long time ago. He and the hospital had the money, staff, and facilities to save these elderly men and women from the failing social safety nets barely keeping them afloat, so all they required such excessive funds for was lobbying and bribing in the prefectural legislative circuits. Not only did this genius conceit for a character&mdash;a character who appears out of the blue and delivers more thematic weight in a single episode than most anime do thought their entire run, by the way&mdash;offer a legitimate, thoroughly realistic, believably technical, and emotionally characterized methodology to &ldquo;Save Japan,&rdquo; as it were, but his actions then serve to assert such ingeniously progressive developments would be possible to implement in real life if not for the gross about of bureaucratic red tape in which these premodern labor regulations are tied up in. So you tell me, dear reader, as the ending theme of such a dense episode played and everything sunk in, what would you have walked away from the experience with: Doctor Hiura&rsquo;s convictions and the thematically gigantic implications of his character, or the fact you almost saw the enigmatic Supporter, a faceless antagonist to a plot which has already built itself as a sold foundation and taken a back seat to the ideas of the cast and personality of the show?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd this is continuously the case. Kenji Kamiyama&rsquo;s first and foremost priority was always the ideas and the beating heart behind them, never the plot which gave them structure. Be it similarly intelligent examples of walking, talking, sociopolitical thesis statements of characters like Ryo Yuki, an expertly portrayed and obviously creator-experienced embodiment of the disaffected loser who became an internet-radicalized school shooter, or Kuroha Shiratori, an equally expert portrayal of an emotionally twisted but unfortunately true-to-life embodiment of the undeserving victim who misguidedly used their intensely personal misfortune to justify their newfound vindictive bigotry, Eden of the East keeps on turning out example after example of genius commentary birthed from deeply written and maturely scripted characterization until Akira finally makes a statement of his own and defines the show. His vision of saving Japan wasn&rsquo;t about the ramifications of Number One&rsquo;s domestic terrorism, his vision of saving Japan wasn&rsquo;t about those missiles&mdash;holy shit, I&rsquo;m actually tearing up right now&mdash;it was about those he chose to take them down. Akira didn&rsquo;t sit down and analytically determine the NEET population to be the premier hacking force to thwart this attack. He simply thought better of them than they do themselves and wanted to present them with this challenge he wholeheartedly believed they could overcome to illustrate this fact to the nation, their nation, which thinks so poorly of them. NEETS may be failures by every traditional standard, but whether they can find a way to convince you of this in your neurotypical society, they&rsquo;re still people budding with untapped potential they&rsquo;ve been too autistic, depressed, or let&rsquo;s be honest, oppressed to showcase, and it&rsquo;s an extraordinary event of social rebellion like this which they can use to prove it. Not only is episode eleven no let down, but it&rsquo;s also the perfect ending. And this is why I feel like Kamiyama found himself somewhat aimless in his endeavor to wrap up the plot. Not in his endeavor to conclude the satisfying character arcs, those were open and shut with quite the catharsis. Not in his endeavor to conclude the telling of his emotional and inspiring message, that was sent so deep into my soul I think I may still be alive. Not in his endeavor to conclude the display of his visual direction, that was done, like, five seconds into the show with some of the most clever cinematic timing I&rsquo;ve ever seen. But specifically in his endeavor to conclude the technical plot, I think he found himself listless if not downright unmotivated. After all, he did what mattered, and likely, all he really ever set out to do in the first place. Eden of the East was initially planned to be a twenty six episode show like all prior productions of the Kamiyama Team, but it was soon changed to two seasons of assumably thirteen episodes each, and it was then changed to an eleven episode season followed by a sequel of openly undetermined length, which was eventually announced as the sequel films we ended up getting. What I&rsquo;m about to say is just my personal speculation based on how air-tight Production IG&rsquo;s scheduling has always been, especially at a time in their history when they were enjoying this much stability, but personally, I believe this uncharacteristically erratic sequence of proposed structures for the series was a result of Kamiyama getting too good and telling the story too fast. He and his masterfully dense scripting expended all the ideas, themes, and characterization he thought up only to realize the plot he made to carry it all was way more intricate than it ever needed to be. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe sequel films following the TV anime boil down to narrative housekeeping, and while they&rsquo;re inoffensive on paper, they&rsquo;re little more than a husk of the magnificent work of art which the series defined itself as on TV. The ideologically unique value running through its creative veins ran dry, and so too did the brilliant plot developments, striking direction, &amp; deep character writing, with only the production quality holding strong. I could stomach The King of Eden, if only for the Air King motif, the only smart and characteristically clever idea the films have to offer, but by the end of Paradise Lost, I had completely given up faith in a comeback. However, do the unfortunate reality of the films make the TV anime what everyone says it is? Fuck no, it doesn&rsquo;t! Eden of the East is a clear masterpiece to anyone with an eye for quality animation production and intelligent writing, and as a deeply moving, staggeringly dense study on NEETs and the socioeconomic paradigms which birthed them, it more than earned its place in the illustrious catalog of Production IG&rsquo;s now legendary Kamiyama Team. It boasts the standard-setting visual polish, flair, and consistency of Production IG, the atmospherically exceptional score of Kenji Kawai, the artistically jaw-dropping background art of Takeda Y\u016bsuke, the emotionally genius and thoroughly mature character writing of Sh\u014dtar\u014d Suga, the unforgettably iconic cinematic prowess of Masayuki Yoshihara, and of course, the meticulous narrative planning and technical concepts of Kenji Kamiyama himself, and it utilizes them all to construct a sensational and profound work of art which owes its countless intellectual and experiential successes to their unfathomable talents and singular achievements, and the fact people tout such a work to be of poor quality is truly, non-sarcastically baffling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for reading."}},{node:{id:6372,title:"Higashi no Eden Movie I: The King of Eden",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/19101.jpg",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/19101l.jpg"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:4,num_episodes_watched:1,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2022-02-21T20:16:40+00:00",tags:["My thoughts on this anime were too long for the tags.

Stupid, I know, which is why I changed it, hoping it would allow more outstanding works in a series to gain the recognition they deserved, leaving behind their less exceptional installments. Just as planned, Eden of the East, finally unrestrained by the questionable quality of its sequel films who&rsquo;d long since held it down, found itself near the summit of My Favorites List where it always belonged. However, some anime to whom this change was meant to benefit didn&rsquo;t get the same treatment, and these unfortunate exceptions really helped me understand the actual ramifications of the changes to my list I myself made. Mobile Police Patlabor and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni are great examples to cherry pick which best exemplify this phenomenon, because the former is the only anime which benefitted from the changes to my list even more than Eden of the East, and the latter is the only anime which didn&rsquo;t manage to benefit from the changes at all. Mobile Police Patlabor is a case of two films animated by Production IG, the greatest animation studio in the world, directed by Mamoru Oshii, the best director in cinematic history, and written by Kazunori Ito, one of the most brilliant writers in the industry, which were held down by their associated OVAs, TV anime, and atrocious sequel film which I could never force myself to add to My Favorites List in accordance with the retarded rules I built it with, so while this is a dramatic instance, I still found myself unable to raise up other shows I adored, such as Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, which shouldn&rsquo;t have kept their scores of less than or equal to Six without their inferior prequels, sequels, or spin-offs holding them down any longer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnbeknownst to me, what I failed to factor in was the inability of outstanding installments to an inconsistent series to reap the benefits of the changes when they may or may not have actually been able to stand on their own two feet as complete and effectively self-contained stories, and while, yes, you can nitpick elements of the aforementioned examples like the fact you wouldn&rsquo;t have known Kanuka Clancy had you not seen the original Mobile Police Patlabor OVAs, the minuscule details which the entries off the list take with them are nowhere near enough to drag the entires on the list back off because&mdash;and this is the important part&mdash;those aren&rsquo;t what made me care about what of the series I do to begin with. To me, the principle value in Mobile Police Patlabor is its outstanding writing, intricate narrative planning, contemplative theming, and mature characterization (at least in the hyper-realistic films), so removing an element as trivial as a side character&#039;s introduction does not take away from the work in that sense. But with a more visceral work who&rsquo;s appeal is more primal, like Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, this mold is broken by the fact something more experiential requires a payoff more tangible. What makes season one of that show so addicting is all its twists and turns which it weaves throughout its world which itself is so well built, you become seriously immersed despite its nearly ostentatious thrill and excessive tonal stylization. Therefore, the contrived and bloodless conclusion to the second season which utterly disrespects the cutthroat stakes and brutal consequences the series had worked so hard to establish robs it of that capacity for immersion and serves to invalidate the worth of the entire series. The fact the final arc&mdash;which itself is the singular narrative thru-line to the plot as a whole&mdash;is utterly squandered by such a death of tone, makes the entire show feel like a waste of time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEden of the East is not like this. The storyline of the TV anime is so incredibly smart in writing and meaningful on concept, and while its ending is certainly riddled with loose-ends, it&rsquo;s unfinished, so what of the plot the show afforded itself time to unravel is what&rsquo;s open to fair critique, and there are no plot holes with which to do so yet. Both as an ensemble cast and as individual personalities, the Sele&ccedil;&atilde;o are increasingly rife with the contemplative theming and clever sociopolitical commentary which makes Kenji Kamiyama the unequivocal genius he is, and they are so in a manner so timely and important to the empathetic, sympathetic, humanistic characters which the series has already made you love and care for, and to the world outside the screen which its messages dissect and which its implications commentate on, that by the end of the show you&rsquo;ve completely forgotten about the actual machinations of Mister Outside, The Suppoter, or the established villains abusing the game in the absence of its maker. I mean, look at it this way, Sele&ccedil;&atilde;o Number Five, Doctor Hajime Hiura, is a man who&rsquo;s reading of the phrase &ldquo;Save Japan,&rdquo; a directive who&rsquo;s purposely interpretive nature couldn&rsquo;t be more thoughtful, was to remedy the pressing issue of the country&rsquo;s rapidly growing elderly population who&rsquo;s retirement funds can no longer pay for increasingly expensive healthcare and assisted living facilities. To realize this imperative goal, Doctor Hiura uses funds which he already owned as the superintendent and corporate owner of a hospital district to expand and renovate the geriatric wards, essentially annexing a retirement home, and then hiring his elderly patients en mass, providing the same white collar desk jobs they used to work, only now with housing and direct care as benefits. Not only does this built a legitimate community, but it solves the issue at hand by overcoming the issue most businesses have with keeping their elderly employees employed, healthcare and insurance, by having them literally work whilst in care. As if this wasn&rsquo;t a statement of socioeconomic renaissance on its own rights, what makes this idea for a character even more intelligent is the fact Doctor Hiura only needed to use his ten billion yen from Juiz to influence the shortsighted labor laws which were keeping him from doing this a long time ago. He and the hospital had the money, staff, and facilities to save these elderly men and women from the failing social safety nets barely keeping them afloat, so all they required such excessive funds for was lobbying and bribing in the prefectural legislative circuits. Not only did this genius conceit for a character&mdash;a character who appears out of the blue and delivers more thematic weight in a single episode than most anime do thought their entire run, by the way&mdash;offer a legitimate, thoroughly realistic, believably technical, and emotionally characterized methodology to &ldquo;Save Japan,&rdquo; as it were, but his actions then serve to assert such ingeniously progressive developments would be possible to implement in real life if not for the gross about of bureaucratic red tape in which these premodern labor regulations are tied up in. So you tell me, dear reader, as the ending theme of such a dense episode played and everything sunk in, what would you have walked away from the experience with: Doctor Hiura&rsquo;s convictions and the thematically gigantic implications of his character, or the fact you almost saw the enigmatic Supporter, a faceless antagonist to a plot which has already built itself as a sold foundation and taken a back seat to the ideas of the cast and personality of the show?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd this is continuously the case. Kenji Kamiyama&rsquo;s first and foremost priority was always the ideas and the beating heart behind them, never the plot which gave them structure. Be it similarly intelligent examples of walking, talking, sociopolitical thesis statements of characters like Ryo Yuki, an expertly portrayed and obviously creator-experienced embodiment of the disaffected loser who became an internet-radicalized school shooter, or Kuroha Shiratori, an equally expert portrayal of an emotionally twisted but unfortunately true-to-life embodiment of the undeserving victim who misguidedly used their intensely personal misfortune to justify their newfound vindictive bigotry, Eden of the East keeps on turning out example after example of genius commentary birthed from deeply written and maturely scripted characterization until Akira finally makes a statement of his own and defines the show. His vision of saving Japan wasn&rsquo;t about the ramifications of Number One&rsquo;s domestic terrorism, his vision of saving Japan wasn&rsquo;t about those missiles&mdash;holy shit, I&rsquo;m actually tearing up right now&mdash;it was about those he chose to take them down. Akira didn&rsquo;t sit down and analytically determine the NEET population to be the premier hacking force to thwart this attack. He simply thought better of them than they do themselves and wanted to present them with this challenge he wholeheartedly believed they could overcome to illustrate this fact to the nation, their nation, which thinks so poorly of them. NEETS may be failures by every traditional standard, but whether they can find a way to convince you of this in your neurotypical society, they&rsquo;re still people budding with untapped potential they&rsquo;ve been too autistic, depressed, or let&rsquo;s be honest, oppressed to showcase, and it&rsquo;s an extraordinary event of social rebellion like this which they can use to prove it. Not only is episode eleven no let down, but it&rsquo;s also the perfect ending. And this is why I feel like Kamiyama found himself somewhat aimless in his endeavor to wrap up the plot. Not in his endeavor to conclude the satisfying character arcs, those were open and shut with quite the catharsis. Not in his endeavor to conclude the telling of his emotional and inspiring message, that was sent so deep into my soul I think I may still be alive. Not in his endeavor to conclude the display of his visual direction, that was done, like, five seconds into the show with some of the most clever cinematic timing I&rsquo;ve ever seen. But specifically in his endeavor to conclude the technical plot, I think he found himself listless if not downright unmotivated. After all, he did what mattered, and likely, all he really ever set out to do in the first place. Eden of the East was initially planned to be a twenty six episode show like all prior productions of the Kamiyama Team, but it was soon changed to two seasons of assumably thirteen episodes each, and it was then changed to an eleven episode season followed by a sequel of openly undetermined length, which was eventually announced as the sequel films we ended up getting. What I&rsquo;m about to say is just my personal speculation based on how air-tight Production IG&rsquo;s scheduling has always been, especially at a time in their history when they were enjoying this much stability, but personally, I believe this uncharacteristically erratic sequence of proposed structures for the series was a result of Kamiyama getting too good and telling the story too fast. He and his masterfully dense scripting expended all the ideas, themes, and characterization he thought up only to realize the plot he made to carry it all was way more intricate than it ever needed to be. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe sequel films following the TV anime boil down to narrative housekeeping, and while they&rsquo;re inoffensive on paper, they&rsquo;re little more than a husk of the magnificent work of art which the series defined itself as on TV. The ideologically unique value running through its creative veins ran dry, and so too did the brilliant plot developments, striking direction, &amp; deep character writing, with only the production quality holding strong. I could stomach The King of Eden, if only for the Air King motif, the only smart and characteristically clever idea the films have to offer, but by the end of Paradise Lost, I had completely given up faith in a comeback. However, do the unfortunate reality of the films make the TV anime what everyone says it is? Fuck no, it doesn&rsquo;t! Eden of the East is a clear masterpiece to anyone with an eye for quality animation production and intelligent writing, and as a deeply moving, staggeringly dense study on NEETs and the socioeconomic paradigms which birthed them, it more than earned its place in the illustrious catalog of Production IG&rsquo;s now legendary Kamiyama Team. It boasts the standard-setting visual polish, flair, and consistency of Production IG, the atmospherically exceptional score of Kenji Kawai, the artistically jaw-dropping background art of Takeda Y\u016bsuke, the emotionally genius and thoroughly mature character writing of Sh\u014dtar\u014d Suga, the unforgettably iconic cinematic prowess of Masayuki Yoshihara, and of course, the meticulous narrative planning and technical concepts of Kenji Kamiyama himself, and it utilizes them all to construct a sensational and profound work of art which owes its countless intellectual and experiential successes to their unfathomable talents and singular achievements, and the fact people tout such a work to be of poor quality is truly, non-sarcastically baffling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for reading."}},{node:{id:6637,title:"Higashi no Eden Movie II: Paradise Lost",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/26126.jpg",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/26126l.jpg"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:1,num_episodes_watched:1,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2020-11-07T20:11:43+00:00",tags:["My thoughts on this anime were too long for the tags. Please click the More button to the left of the score to see the Comments for my thoughts."],comments:"I often lament the anime community around me and their baffling acceptance and praise of works which are so blatantly undeserving of it, but putting my pretentious prose aside, comments such as these are often purely facetious, since I am far too jaded and accustomed to be truly surprised by the success of even the most flagrant garbage. To exclaim, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe people like this,&rdquo; is really to maliciously, passive aggressively imply, &ldquo;People really should not like this.&rdquo; Be it liking Naruto and Bleach for your nostalgia or liking My Hero Academia and Mob Psycho 100 because e-celebrities told you to, every anime who&rsquo;s popularity I find to be &ldquo;baffling&rdquo; has one or two&mdash;maybe not good, but&mdash;valid and easily discernible reasons for earning the adoration of the audience it has. While this phenomenon goes both ways, given how often I find myself whining and wondering why some shows don&rsquo;t have praise and recognition I feel they should, this is almost exclusively due to a show&rsquo;s sheer lack of exposure. It&#039;s not people calling a good show bad; it&rsquo;s just people not praising a show because they simply aren&rsquo;t aware of its existence. Rarely do I witness the actual opposite effect, people collectively bashing an anime they all know of which deserves to be celebrated, and on top of that, even when this does happen in earnest, it&#039;s only by a small and obtusely vocal minority who are hating on something for a silly reason and making more of a fool out of themselves than the anime in question, be it a fandom grudge like that against Nisekoi, mass contrarianism like that regarding Psycho-Pass, an e-celebrity&rsquo;s radical followers like those after A Place Further Than the Universe, or the community at large outright not understanding it like Paranoia Agent. Eden of the East, though, is the first real example of the community as a whole seeming to be in total agreement, with great conviction, a good show is bad.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeeing as the statement I&rsquo;m about to discuss is so put-on, after having witnessed it used in public discourse once, I immediately sought to find out who first said it, as there was simply no way in hell it was a consensus opinion naturally birthed out of the either, and while I predictably found it propagated by two YouTube personalities by the names Glass Reflection and Digibro, I&rsquo;m still fascinated by how taken the community became with a misapprehension so utterly misguided. &ldquo;It has a criminally unsatisfying ending.&rdquo; This statement, at least in my own experience, has perforated every critical discussion of Eden of the East since the dawn of its finale, and I think it paints a much larger picture of the mass misunderstanding of this show than most of the people brainlessly regurgitating it may realize. All these normies oblivious to deep theming, casuals unwilling to empathize with a story they don&rsquo;t resonate with directly, and immature kids, teens, and college kids call the ending a let-down, but should you be a NEET among the show&rsquo;s respectably minuscule target audience, it&#039;s quite the opposite. When you see Tetsuya Nishio and Takashi Hashimoto&rsquo;s jaw dropping display of those missiles getting shot down whist Reveal the World is playing over Masayuki Yoshihara&rsquo;s iconic episode direction, you think, wow, losers like me really can be something. Following my first viewing of that utterly sublime scene, at least after I was finished wiping the tears off my face and blowing my nose, I was honestly shocked to find this eleven episode gem had a sequel. It was like I&rsquo;d only just remembered the show had a plot, a very interesting plot which served as the vehicle for all the priceless theming and characterization which made the show a masterpiece in the first place, but a plot which nevertheless took a backseat for their sake and which did not need to wrap up to do what the show set out to do at heart. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nActually, Eden of the East, the TV anime, was only recently allowed on My Favorites List.

I was really, really proud of how it was turning out. In fact, if you don&rsquo;t count the brilliant Tomodachi Game review I worked with dragonclaws on, then it was my best work of the season. But before finishing it, I had a thought.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Wait a second. This review isn&rsquo;t just good. It&rsquo;s creative. My Psycho-Pass 3 review was deleted for being too creative. Ever since then, I&rsquo;ve always made sure to never use my imagination and to never try to do anything innovative, fun, or original with any of my reviews. How could I suddenly forget that? I mean, there&rsquo;s probably a stupid and pointless rule in the guidelines specifically tailored to allow the mods to delete this review as well.&rdquo; I immediately went and checked, and, sure enough, there it was. The stupid and pointless rule placed there for the sole purpose of limiting creativity in the community. Knowing my review would get reported, as all of them do, I realized there was no longer any point in continuing the project knowing full well what would happen when I posted it, so I had to chop it to pieces, salvage what I could, and write something more traditional. The review was essentially an enthusiastic recommendation of the anime, Love After World Domination, packaged within and weaved throughout a damning dissection of Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san, and I thought it was really good (or at least what I had done of it was really good). However, it would&rsquo;ve been reported and taken down on the basis of the rule that reads, &ldquo;Reviews must NOT: focus solely on comparing any adaptation, source material or other works to the entry. A few sentences for general information is alright, but remember that your review is a critique of the work itself, not a comparison.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re now thinking, &ldquo;But hold on a minute. Sure, maybe the community would report you, but wouldn&rsquo;t the mods have the reading comprehension to see you weren&rsquo;t simply comparing Anime X with Anime Y and rightly dismiss the reports? It sounds to me like you just bitched out and needlessly trashed a review you worked your ass off pulling together just because of some last-minute doubts which could&rsquo;ve easily never materialized. You should&rsquo;ve just finished and posted the creative version of the review.&rdquo; Then I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re being too optimistic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy Psycho-Pass 3 review was creative. When I watched the show, I very quickly realized it was bad, and I very quickly realized it was bad for all the reasons I expected it to be bad. This realization was the inspiration for the review, because I knew it would be bad the moment I learned Tow Ubukata was writing it. &ldquo;After all, aren&rsquo;t all Tow Ubukata&rsquo;s works bad? And, more importantly, aren&rsquo;t they all bad for the exact same reasons? Yeah. They are, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; I then took that idea to its logical extreme and wrote a piece simply describing who Tow Ubukata was, why who he was informed the way he writes stories, and why all his stories are badly written for the exact same reasons. If you think the mods would have the reading comprehension to appreciate the subtly of my described original review for Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san, then surely, SURELY they couldn&rsquo;t POSSIBLY fail to fucking realize that, maybe, JUST MAYBE, the review posted in the review section for Psycho-Pass 3 talking about how all anime written by a certain man are all bad for the same reasons and then listing those reasons in great detail, AND PSYCHO-PASS 3 IS ALSO WRITTEN BY THAT MAN, then it might just be reasonable to assume all the criticism contained in the review talking about his other works might actually apply to Psycho-Pass 3 as well, then you would be mistaken. My Psycho-Pass 3 review was removed shortly after being posted and gaining the number one spot for, and I fucking quote, &ldquo;lack of detail.&rdquo; I had apparently failed to &ldquo;give readers a chance to understand how [I] personally [felt] about the work,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;in this specific case, [my] review [lacked] analysis on the anime itself.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver the last two years, I&rsquo;ve gotten more popular, and all my big reviews are routinely mass reported. This has been openly admitted and widely corroborated by multiple mods, and it&rsquo;s gotten so bad at times, that one mod has even accidentally sent a report repeal to me instead of the person who reported me, because they visit my page and are forced to message me that fucking often. The mod who deleted my Psycho-Pass 3 review (and who tried to delete many more throughout the course of 2018-19) also has retired since then. I&rsquo;ve also come to know and respect many of the current mods like gaussian_, kekekeKaj, and I guess also Casual, but I&rsquo;ve known him since before he joined up, so I don&rsquo;t know if that counts. However, they don&rsquo;t give me preferential treatment at all, and while the rules they operate under are fucking mind-numbingly retarded, they still have integrity and discipline, so when someone would inevitably report my review, they wouldn&rsquo;t talk to the site admins about changing the sub-functional IQ brainpaste puddle of vomit that is the current Review Guidelines to try and save my review. They would just say sorry and delete it. Whether we&rsquo;re putting current circumstances aside or not, though, I would argue my lack of optimism and my feeling the need to smother my own creativity was and is warranted after the fucking criminal murder of my piece on Psycho-Pass 3.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnyway, the point of saying all this? To say what I wanted to say in my review: go watch Love After World Domination."}},{node:{id:39326,title:"Kawaikereba Hentai demo Suki ni Natte Kuremasu ka?",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1430/102439.jpg",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1430/102439l.jpg"}},list_status:{status:"dropped",score:2,num_episodes_watched:1,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2019-07-09T03:18:56+00:00",tags:[],comments:""}},{node:{id:39112,title:"Kawaki wo Ameku",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1776/121796.webp",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1776/121796l.webp"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:4,num_episodes_watched:1,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2022-02-23T00:31:30+00:00",tags:["Fantastic music","meh video."],comments:""}},{node:{id:37965,title:"Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1936/129119.jpg",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1936/129119l.jpg"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:7,num_episodes_watched:23,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2022-02-13T07:00:22+00:00",tags:["Production IG's monumental comeback from the technical disappointment that was Welcome to the Ballroom.

Please click the More button to the left of the score to see the Comments for my thoughts."],comments:"While the actual intellectual content of the scene reflects my deep seated issues with the overall take-away from Monster, the opening scene of my never-to-be-published-let-alone-finished book is a referential parody of a recurring scene from Mawaru Penguindrum in its structure, flow, and presentation. Mawaru Penguindrum and I have a strained relationship to say the absolute least, and said tension between us almost directly mirrors that of the tightening and loosening tension between myself and its eccentric, experimental, and exceptionally avant-garde creator, Kunihiko Ikuhara. Ikuhara was at once my least favorite creative director in the entire medium of Japanese animation whom I despised with a truly fiery passion, then he later evolved into merely an object of obsessive intrigue whose creations I wished to parse out of a purely scholarly interest, and now he&rsquo;s just kind of like an old friend, someone I think about every so often and passively wonder about. The reason my opinion of the man has been so radically inconsistent and drastically shifting over the years is because of the fact my ability to comprehend the madness he brings to screen has historically been just as variable, and so to has my tendency to take my lack of understanding in either stride or rage, hence my constantly recast feelings. Ikuhara, simply put, is a genius, and while anyone can recognize this fact, nearly no one&mdash;very, very, very much including myself&mdash;can comprehend this fact. My first Ikuhara show was Mawaru Penguindrum, and while I&rsquo;d given it a Three at the time, you had better believe I hated it more vehemently than anything I&rsquo;d ever even thought about giving a One. Be it the Tomino level esoteric character motivations, the Shinbou on crack directing style, or its utterly obscured thematic messages which the work went out of its own way to obfuscate the meaning of behind titanic walls of symbolism and codifications, everything Mawaru Penguindrum had to offer pissed me off on some level upon my first viewing, and the scene which was most emblematic of this anger and confusion was the scene which my book mirrors. In both the first and last episode of the show, there&rsquo;s a point where a scene taking place in the main characters&rsquo; house breaks to pan outward onto the street where two young boys are discussing author Kenji Miyazawa&rsquo;s ubiquitous Japanese classic, Night on the Galactic Railroad, a book adapted to film which is also fairly interpretive and intricate, but which the average intellectual thinker could parse without much issue&hellip;with the exception of one scene. And it&rsquo;s this one scene, this one god damned scene and its god damned apple which the two boys are discussing. While one of the boys understands the work intimately, the other is hopelessly clueless, so the former is attempting to explain it. However, seeing as the scene in question is as utterly perplexing as any Ikuhara work is&mdash;such as that in which they find themselves, for example&mdash;the boy can only really do his best at explaining it in abstract terms, and the other is consequentially left even more confused in the end. Needless to say, since I simply couldn&rsquo;t help projecting myself onto the boy getting condescendingly lectured down to by Ikuhara&rsquo;s author insert, this always infuriated me&mdash;that is, offering an explanation to your way-too-deep work via a scene from another work which is equally way-too-deep&mdash;but as exhaustively as it maddened me, I suppose it influenced me just as thoroughly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBoy One//1: So, it&rsquo;s setting itself up to be this real deep thing, right? But then, you learn he was brainwashed by Nazis! <br />\r\nBoy Two//1: &hellip;Okay?<br />\r\nBoy One//2: But that totally ruins it!<br />\r\nBoy Two//2: Why?<br />\r\nBoy One//3: Because of course he&rsquo;s a monster! It kills all the intrigue, you know?<br />\r\nBoy Two//3: It&rsquo;s not like every killer was brainwashed by Nazis, though.<br />\r\nBoy One//4: Exactly! That&rsquo;s why it kills it, because [i]every[/i] person whose been brainwashed by Nazis [i]was[/i] a killer.<br />\r\nBoy Two//4: But that doesn&rsquo;t make him any less of a monster.<br />\r\nBoy One//5: But it does! No matter what crime he commits, it&rsquo;s always going to be [i]because[/i] he was brainwashed by Nazis. It&rsquo;s so boring!<br />\r\nBoy Two//5: Why are you so obsessed with how he got like that?<br />\r\nBoy One//6: No, no, no. You don&rsquo;t understand. How they got there [i]is[/i] what makes a monster scary.<br />\r\nBoy Two//6: And getting brainwashed by Nazis isn&rsquo;t scary to you?<br />\r\nBoy One//7: Never mind. You just don&rsquo;t get it.                                                                                                                              <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy version of the discussion is nowhere near as abstruse as Ikuhara&rsquo;s, but once again, I stress the fact it was only meant to imitate his work on a structural level, and moreover, I actually want people to understand my work should I ever finish it, so I wouldn&rsquo;t make it so intellectually impenetrable even if I had the writing skills with which to do so or a message so deep to tell. Either way, I&rsquo;ve made my point, and it is my exact issue with Monster and its so called themes&mdash;forgetting about, at least for now, how awfully executed and lazily written it is in a general sense. Frankly, Johan is undoubtably among the most fundamentally meaningless villains I&rsquo;ve ever been cursed to bear witness to, and I think it boils down to the fact Monster is&mdash;for lack of a better term&mdash;a work for normies, people who don&rsquo;t need a good reason to invest in a narrative before falling victim to its emotional manipulation, or in terms of my book, people like Boy Two. These are people who turn on the news after a hard day&rsquo;s work and passively distress over the horrific crimes and calamities they see reported on, no matter their lack of connection to the woeful individuals on screen nor matter the fact their lives and long term emotions will be utterly unaffected by the plight of those on the other side of the media paraded in front of them. These are the kinds of people who will turn off a series if it crosses a certain line or pushes a certain button, the kinds of people who can stomach a work as outwardly edgy as Monster only because it doesn&rsquo;t actually get inside their heads and doesn&rsquo;t have the contemplative value to haunt them after their casual viewing has ended like a truly deep and meaningful show would, the kinds of people who subconsciously watch said late-night news because of its potential as softcore drama&mdash;foreign wars give the illusion of peace at home&mdash;but if the news were to report the unadulterated facts which make the over-dramatized atrocities around the globe actually hit home, like the fact the munitions fueling those wars are made domestically and distributed by proxy so the next third-world country can start their next civil war in effect of their next genocide, then no one would brave those channels. These are the kinds of people who look at Johan as this deeply disgusting figure for doing the things he does, when in reality, the deeper you go, the less you&rsquo;ll find. Johan is a serial killer, yes, and if a pointless, archetypical, underdeveloped character murdering other pointless, archetypical, underdeveloped characters can actually affect you, cool, but he was conditioned to be this way in his upbringing, so the crimes he commits lose any and all potential for thematic meaning whatsoever, as they are not born of his own natural convictions and are instead surface-level plot points to facilitate this cardboard cutout of a narrative. Villains are supposed to have motivations, which Johan very well does, but said motivations are supposed to be enticing and thought provoking by way of their intensely personal birth&mdash;a purpose and goal which is downright despicable, but one which is still developed from enough human emotion to be terrifyingly empathetic&mdash;which is why, ultimately, what makes a villain psychologically or philosophically valuable is their ability to say something bigger and ponderous about the human condition as opposed to the singular condition of one thoughtless and contrived individual, and there are countless examples of villains who do just that, and so much more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Laughing Man from Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, a young man caught up in medical corruption and robbed of criminal justice by the political players influencing the legal processes behind the scenes who decides the only way to uproot the weeds of the conspiracy is to take those who cheated him at gunpoint and expose the truth by force, only to reveal, after all was said and done, the revolutionary hack which initially hid his identity from the cameras and pedestrian cyberbrains which witnessed him threatening the conspirators live on TV was not of his own design, implying his fight to be so widely recognized as righteous, it had been independently supported by anonymous actors from the start; Hideo Tsuge from Mobile Police Patlabor 2 The Movie, a scarred veteran so despondent with the manner in which peacetime deludes first-world citizens into thinking wars are exclusively foreign to their infallible safe havens of civilized society, he and his militant followers launch indiscriminate terror attacks in Tokyo to orchestrate a mock-war on a stage ignorantly thought to be safe for the sole purpose of illustrating the fragility of order for those he feels have taken advantage of it; Shogo Makishima from Psycho-Pass, a counter-culture political thinker turned sociopathic serial killer capable of getting away with murder in a society wherein your state of mind and willingness to commit a crime can be scanned and fully analyzed at distance against your will, because he believes the deterministic dystopian systems in place to have taken away the decision making abilities of the populace to such a degree, he can&rsquo;t even see them as human beings anymore and, therefore, can murder ruthlessly without registering it as a criminal act, even subconsciously; Bondrewd from Made in Abyss, a scientific innovator once laudable on paper who then refused to accept his limitations as a human mortal and stopped at nothing to find a way around the all-powerful curse holding humanity back from the depths of mystery the abyss has to offer only to become so consumed in his endeavors as to willingly commit utterly heinous atrocities in human experimentation, ironically, as his attempt to avoid the dehumanizing curse only caused him to lose his humanity, and his attempt to overcome the very point at which one can never physically return from marks the point at which he could never be redeemed; and most iconically, Griffith from Berserk, an orphan from the slums who dared to dream of ruling his own freed nation and who, in turn, fought his way up the brutal social and military ladder of the medieval aristocracy in which he found himself, even going so far as to sell his body to progress his standing without having to put his comrades through even more bloodshed, only to reach a point where the only way forward was to sacrifice those devotees of his who&rsquo;d helped him get so far, a point at which he was too ambitious and too far along his goal to stick his nose up at the immorality of the choice to be made. Hell, Eichi Hoba from Mobile Police Patlabor The Movie is a deeper, more valuable villain than 99% of fictional antagonists in history by way of the timeless sociopolitical commentary carried by his acts of commercial and infrastructural rebellion against a society whom he believes to have forgotten its roots by letting the city degrade for the sole purpose of razing it and rebuilding even taller towers atop its ruins, challenging the realm of the Gods, as he believed, and he&rsquo;s literally DEAD before the movie even starts! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nJohan, however, is an indiscriminate killer who manipulates and intimidates his inevitable victims and undertakes a chase of epic design with any and all players he feels will bring sufficient challenge and interest to the game that is his life, and he embarks upon such a trail of blood because why? Because he was written as a statement of political, social, even commercial commentary? Because he was written as an exploration of morality, religion, or objectivity? Because he was written as a case study, a character study on desire, ambition, revenge, romance, ANY emotion? Because he was meant to MEAN ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING?!? No. Because he was brainwashed and experiment on by Nazis, and is therefore insane. An edgy backstory, if that gets you going, but it means nothing. Nothing except the fact Naoki Urasawa is such a foreigner to mental health issues, he thinks the only way an individual can find themselves crazed is if they underwent a stereotypically atrocious upbringing which conditioned them into being so, and while growing up in 511 Kinderheim is the single most ham-fisted metaphor for a broken home in the history of narrative art and literature, I recognize the drama of the set-up is purposeful, because how else could you justify such a monstrous villain if his or her backstory wasn&rsquo;t just that bad...right? WRONG! News flash, kiddos. You don&rsquo;t have to be subjected to human experimentation to grow up a twisted mess. When you read the manifestos of all these mass shooters, their memoirs don&rsquo;t detail the lives of Nazi guinea pigs, they detail the lives of normal people who have been subtly tortured by society in a manner of ways so nuanced as to be untraceable. Convictions aside, Johan does what he does because of his Mother&rsquo;s unfair and inhumane treatment from those around her as well as the bleak realities of her life which convinced him as a child all humans are of the same sadist nature as those who victimized his Mother, and given the opportunity, they would all give in to their monstrous instincts with ease. In the end, however, Tenma proves to be his foil by letting him go instead of killing him as he set out to do. But if this pretty little development is where the series is supposed to get deep in any meaningful way whatsoever, then I must say it still falls short, because once again, his Mother&rsquo;s development &amp; motivation remain completely and totally seated in circumstance, not conviction or ideals, so even if you were to try and find meaning in Johan&rsquo;s meaninglessness, the only one who you could trace it back to is a character equally meaningless through her sheer lack of agency and personal consequence outside contrived misfortune which would naturally have her calling for revenge. I mean, just take ANY example from those I mentioned above. How about Bondrewd? The kinds of people who like Monster are the kinds of people who criticizes and perceive the Bondrewd Arc as being cheap for continuously using the pain and suffering of children to elicit emotion from its audience, when in reality that isn&rsquo;t the point at all, it only seems so on the surface to those too simple to read between the lines. The awful things which happen to Prushka and the other children serve in large part to develop Bondrewd&rsquo;s character, and the narrative surrounding him isn&rsquo;t even strictly tragic. Bondrewd isn&rsquo;t a tragic character because tragedy at its core is showing a character with a flaw and how that flaw destroys them, but Bondrewd never gets a significant comeuppance. What makes his story powerful is Bondrewd made the choice to sacrifice everything for progress, and he got his wish. The horror comes from the fact that Bondrewd isn&#039;t irrational, insane, or sociopathic. There&#039;s no way to write him off as a &ldquo;monster&rdquo; so cheaply. He&#039;s right, even if you hate him for it. Even deeper still, you could take the abyss itself to be a metaphor for life and the search for meaning. I think Bondrewd&rsquo;s attempt to manipulate the hellish nature of this world rather than accepting it as natural law is his choice to abandon his fundamental sense of humanity&mdash;or that he tried to reprioritize it to fit with his ambitions, and we get to see in intimate detail how well that went. Note that to even say such things, I have to use the word &ldquo;think,&rdquo; not because I&rsquo;m confused, but because the work and the character actually MAKES ME THINK and is so thoughtful with its implications as to be almost entirely interpretive. What does Monster say? What does Johan say? Parents are influential? Nazis are bad? People are mean? It&#039;s such a pathetic script.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven if such a joke of thematic depth is enough for you, or in other words, even if you don&rsquo;t care about theming, I still don&rsquo;t see how anyone who isn&rsquo;t a normie only consuming media on the barest of surface levels could possibly find Monster interesting at all, because a moral conflict is still a two way street. Remember all those outstanding villains I detailed earlier? In addition to their exciting presence and thought provoking memorability, they all boasted a position next to their own equally brilliant heroes. Tenma is not the epic statement on accepting the scientific advancements of man that is Major Motoko Kusanagi to Johan&rsquo;s Laughing Man, nor is he the pricelessly opinionated labyrinth of a character script that is Kiichi Goto to Johan&rsquo;s Hideo Tsuge, nor is he the unforgettable libertarian badass that is Shinya K\u014dgami to Johan&rsquo;s Shogo Makishima, nor is he the criminally flawed yet somehow redeemable challenger that is Nanachi to Johan&rsquo;s Bondrewd, nor the thoughtfully enigmatic legendary warrior that is Guts to Johan&rsquo;s Griffith. Tenma is the Natsu to Johan&rsquo;s Zeref, an archetypically characterized, paper-thin, utterly insipid, Judeo-Christian based author-insert who&rsquo;s only personality trait is their ability to follow the plot and vomit out endless platitudes. I suppose there is always the too cool for school, epic young nihilist, fresh out of virginity yet already enlightened argument like the one I saw the other day in an Akira thread on /a/, though, and this one post in particular decided to display this talking point with the most characteristically ignorant attitude imaginable, so it is truly perfect for some biased quotation manipulation here in this piece to make me look smarter: &ldquo;Messages and meaning are for fags. The animation looks sick and the soundtrack slaps.&rdquo; So while, yeah, one can make a similar argument for a work like Monster, perhaps touting its strong paneling&mdash;which I know is a term for manga, but this was a direct adaptation where the director was allotted zero creative input, so the insult &ldquo;moving manga&rdquo; really comes to life within this can of worms&mdash;and maybe its highly varied character designs, I guess, as one couldn&rsquo;t really say anything good about its choppy animation, speed-lined background art, any other among the countless cost-cutting techniques it uses to shit scribbles onto animation frames, nor its music, which while genuinely good in composition is ruined by endless reuse throughout the show&rsquo;s ridiculously overlong runtime, such an argument as well as my own both boil down to subjective priorities. No, it&rsquo;s not like I feel the need to be oh-so-intellectually stimulated by every piece of media I consume for every second I consume it as if I&rsquo;m some sort of highbrow connoisseur. I would just be honestly bored otherwise, and whether you find that to be grossly pretentious or not, that&rsquo;s how my mind works, so no matter how much wow factor Johan has to seduce all these kids, teens, and college kids into feeling electrified by his presence, it boils down to the same brainless hype they feel from their favorite shounen antagonist from their favorite Bones show. Which is a great segue into my commentary on the show itself, because if there is one anime out of all four thousand I&rsquo;ve seen which reminds me of Monster the most, it&rsquo;s the previously referenced Fairly Tail. Be it the arc structure, side villain presentation, brain numbing amounts of filler, or all the walking into the sunset style imagery, the execution of Monster is almost identical to that of Fairy Tail, which I can say because I&rsquo;ve watched both to completion. This piece was always going to devolve into a raving diatribe, so trying to preserve its structure would be a waste of time, but the rest may just be an honest to goodness rant, because this show was a real fuck of a headache, even having come to terms with its delusional self-seriousness and worthlessly shallow attempts at theming, because I never know the context to anything that happens. It&rsquo;s all just a string of contrivance for which I don&rsquo;t know the where, why, or when of any scene nor the direct motivations of the actors therein. It&rsquo;s all just layers upon layers of differing levels of excuses as to why the things that should be happening aren&rsquo;t happening quite yet, and all the minuscule little fuck-ups normies and dumbfucks would never notice just pile up endlessly in the background until the mountain of incompetence grows too large to obfuscate. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBlinded by rage, I had to resort to taking notes, which themselves couldn&rsquo;t even last half the show:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&gt;If it wasn&rsquo;t for the nonstop recap and characters expositing to each other things they should already know, this would&rsquo;ve been a fifty episode show at absolute maximum.<br />\r\n&gt;Five seconds ago he was having to hold him back, five seconds later he&rsquo;s having to convince him. Your mother is dying dude!<br />\r\n&gt;He busts in the house, screams &ldquo;Dieter!&rdquo;, and only then decides to start tip-toeing.<br />\r\n&gt;Episode fourteen was fucking retarded and the funniest animated comedy ever produced.<br />\r\n&gt;Hits him with a car, &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t die&rdquo;, then he wakes up, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, we won&#039;t break any of your bones.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&gt;she&rsquo;s talking to a sink half the episode, fucking what<br />\r\n&gt;Wolf sends him to kill Johan but sends no backup.<br />\r\n&gt;There&rsquo;s rumors of the extremists starting a fire all year round, so we don&rsquo;t believe you. Motherfuck, Ayse died for this! She died because she was trying to warn us, TRYING TO WARN US&mdash;OF THE THING THEY JUST ADMITTED TO CATEGORICALLY, UNCONDITIONALLY DISMISS BECAUSE OF THE UBIQUITOUSNESS OF THE RUMORS! SO WHY EVEN KILL HER??!!?<br />\r\n&gt;The fire is in a place where it would be hard for the fire trucks to access, but you&rsquo;re on a GRIDDED STREET!<br />\r\n&gt;I love how the pedestrian was just shocked enough to scream, but not shocked enough to be unable to explicitly offer a very astute assessment of the situation to relay essential exposition to the fucktard audience.<br />\r\n&gt;She had him at gunpoint, so he was backing away, but the sea was at his back so the shot could look dramatic, but the way the car was parked, he would&rsquo;ve gotten out at the other side, so if she had him at gunpoint the entire time, he should&rsquo;ve been backed into the cliff on the other side, not the sea.<br />\r\n&gt;He shoots them with Nina&rsquo;s little four chamber short-pistol, and they fly back like they just got hit with a sawed off shotgun. <br />\r\n&gt;&ldquo;I missed. The husband then walks away holding his wound.&rdquo; THEN YOU DIDN&rsquo;T FUCKING MISS!!<br />\r\n&gt;He&rsquo;s after Tenma, but you bartered information to learn, FROM HIM, where Tenma was, so if he was after Tenma, why didn&rsquo;t he kill him before you&rsquo;re ass even entered the equation?!<br />\r\n&gt;Used Eva as bait in a standoff, but didn&rsquo;t shoot Tenma when he finally reached her AND stood still long enough for her to dramatically recognize him.<br />\r\n&gt;I appreciate the casual camera pan from the hall to the open room in place of a standard hard cut, but the fact the new dude&rsquo;s first line was him insisting on something implies it wasn&rsquo;t the first dialogue of the conversation, but then we should&rsquo;ve heard said conversation over the one we were just listening to in the hallway, but we didn&rsquo;t.<br />\r\n&gt;You can determine a person&rsquo;s personality with a glance.<br />\r\n&gt;Holy FUCK. I just thought to myself, &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen this guy in a while,&rdquo; and I was watching the opening looking at FUCKING TENMA, THE MAIN CHARACTER!<br />\r\n&gt;I love when characters put together this mystery with details they just remembered which we never knew as audience members. It&rsquo;s like, oh, here&rsquo;s this one thing which makes all the pieces fit together, and you&rsquo;re supposed to go, oh, how smart! I didn&rsquo;t even think of that! Well, of course not motherfucker. YOU DIDN&rsquo;T KNOW!<br />\r\n&gt;I love how this guy can feel a fucking disturbance in the force when someone&rsquo;s about to push him onto the train tracks from behind, but he can&rsquo;t put two and two together that motherfuckers are breaking into his office.<br />\r\n&gt;How have you been following him for a quote unquote &ldquo;while&rdquo; if he himself only just arranged for you a place to say? Have you and Dieter been sleeping on the streets?!<br />\r\n&gt;You were enrolled in this new university but say you don&rsquo;t have a place to stay yet? Moreover, how do I even know you were enrolled in said university?? The fact she in particular found you in a library would imply it was at the university library, so you must&rsquo;ve been enrolled, right?! I NEVER FUCKING KNOW THE CONTEXT TO ANY SCENE IN THIS ENTIRE SHOW.<br />\r\n&gt;He&rsquo;s looking AT JOHAN, with NO GUN, mind you, but he is definitely looking AT fucking Johan. There&rsquo;s the big ostentations screech sound effect as Johan menacingly notices him, and then, IMMEDIATELY, he ignores Johan and starts casually taking to some old tree hugger as if there&rsquo;s no tension or stakes or THINGS TO FUCKING DO AT ALL, and the scene ends. MOTHERFUCKER! KILL JOHAN! END MY SUFFERING! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGo ahead. Say it.<br />\r\n&ldquo;kek, seethe harder&rdquo; <br />\r\n&ldquo;cope&rdquo; <br />\r\n&ldquo;filtered&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo quote an old, legendary copypasta, let me explain to you why you think Monster is good: you watched one episode, noted everything was covered in black and grey, and thought its edgy camera angles were super slick. Then you dropped it and said you completed it, exactly like you did with Texhnolyze. Don&rsquo;t fuck with me, motherfucker. I&rsquo;m onto you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJust like you, nobody else wants to watch it. And you use this well to your advantage. That&rsquo;s why you can throw it out as a recommendation, because no one&rsquo;s ever actually going to watch the show and realize you&rsquo;re fucking wrong. See also:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&gt;Legend of the Galactic Heroes<br />\r\n&gt;Slam Dunk<br />\r\n&gt;Mobile Suit Gundam<br />\r\n&gt;Hajime no Ippo<br />\r\n&gt;Touch<br />\r\n&gt;Space Runaway Ideon<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSure, many of those I just listed are great shows, but the point is made. You can safely bet there&rsquo;s no way anyone would watch a series like this all the way through and still be sane enough to criticize it. Following that, anyone who did watch some of the show and admitted to dropping it can then be criticized for not &ldquo;watching the best part,&rdquo; and because these shows are old, you can always play the &ldquo;new thing bad, old thing good&rdquo; card. Brilliant, right?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo, so fuck off with your fake elitist posturing. Nobody&rsquo;s impressed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you had actually finished Monster, you would hate it too.<br />\r\nI&rsquo;m now going to spoil the plot for you since you didn&rsquo;t really get far enough into Monster to realize it, but there really isn&rsquo;t much of a plot at all.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA kid gets shot, and a doctor, Tenma, saves him from dying. A while later, the kid shoots someone in front of Tenma, and Tenma gets all emo, thinking &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the value in saving a life if the person I save kills people?&rdquo; So he decides to go on a journey to meet the kid and find out the answer to his moral dilemma&hellip;for seventy six fucking episodes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat&rsquo;s it. And unless you want me to include its edgy subplots and laughable pseudoscience ramblings, that&rsquo;s the entirety of the seventy six episode story. And don&rsquo;t even get me started on the ending. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe answer to Tenma&rsquo;s moral dilemma is,&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; <br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Yes, there is obviously value and virtue in saving a life regardless of how many people that person may kill.&rdquo; And Tenma illustrates this mentally underdeveloped revelation by saving the psycho&rsquo;s life yet again. Then he walks away, cue credits.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWere you hoping for more? Because that&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s the end of the show. It took seventy six episodes for them to reset the entire story back to episode one. I like to think this was Urasawa&rsquo;s way of telling his fans to cut their wrists deeper than I do and bleed out in a warm bath, and I just wish more of them had respected his wishes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeriously, be honest. Were you intrigued? If so, you probably flogged yourself with a belt to stay awake, and if not, you&rsquo;re probably bored enough to find chewing razor blades entertaining. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI mean&hellip;listen. Monster honestly isn&#039;t even that bad of an idea for a story, and while its characters mostly come across as juvenile parodies of who the author wanted them to be, they aren&#039;t awful character conceits. The problem is that it isn&#039;t a well-directed, well-animated eighty minute movie. Even if they kept all the edgy nonsense like the SUPER SOLIDER PROGRAM&mdash;which, by the way, was a thing&mdash;the resulting story would at least be serviceable if it wasn&#039;t so high on its ideas and self-perceived maturity and sophistication. As it stands, Monster is bad, period, as its torturous length and tediousness accentuate how fucking shallow it all is for over twenty four hours of screen time, but it&#039;s loved by those who believe doing so will make them look smarter and/or older than they really are.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBasically, it ticks all the boxes retards need to feel superior for watching it:<br />\r\n&gt;It&rsquo;s older than most popular anime.<br />\r\n&gt;It&rsquo;s mind-numbingly slow.<br />\r\n&gt;It&rsquo;s focused more on themes, less on actions.<br />\r\n&gt;It&rsquo;s full of boring parts you have to slog through which makes most audiences quit.<br />\r\n&gt;It&rsquo;s lack of substance can always be dismissed by telling critics they &ldquo;just didn&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;<br />\r\nThe only thing it lacks is Evangelion/Ergo Proxy pretentiousness which fans can overanalyse, but which even the creators have admitted don&#039;t actually mean anything.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGoing back to what I was saying earlier, though, I think I took many of those comparisons too far and gave imbeciles too much credit. Like in the case of Bondrewd from Made in Abyss, most criticism toward his arc has nothing to do with the example I cherry picked. If anything, it&rsquo;s rare to find simpleminded critique of themes because people dumb enough to misunderstand themes usually don&rsquo;t pick up on themes in the first place. It would&rsquo;ve been more appropriate to use more commonplace and surface-level examples of criticism, like how people complain about the Dark Reg sequence being an &ldquo;asspull&rdquo; or whatever buzzword they like to use. This kind of misunderstanding boils down to the condescending but honest truth: the pseudo-intellectual sees the main character conveniently unlock his ultimate ability and fly into an unstoppable rage at just the right time to fight an overpowered opponent and criticizes it because they&rsquo;ve seen it countless times in the numerous battle shounen shlock they like to consume, whereas the thinking viewer sees the robotic main character, established in one of the earliest chapters to gain power and strength by absorbing electrical energy, become understandably overloaded both mentally and physically by the entirety of Idofront&#039;s electrical supply running through his circuits and burning off as much of the excess energy as possible in an expectedly violent and animalistic fashion. The main differentiating factor here is logical consistency. Some people can&#039;t accept this fact for whatever bizarre reasons they have, but Made in Abyss has a remarkably solid grasp upon this concept for how integral unexplainable magic and fantasy is to the plot, which is one of the things that makes it such good fiction in the first place. But ultimately, it&rsquo;s just moronic to think action scenes of this nature are exclusive to teen literature, just as it&rsquo;s equally moronic to think teen literature can&rsquo;t disguise its emptiness with the slow-moving and unexciting proceedings of a largely adult cast portrayed in a notably &ldquo;un-anime-like&rdquo; style. Monster is a case study on how to see through these works of fiction which try to seem mature and intelligent, because it so fundamentally fails at doing so whilst ostensibly appearing to have been successful, making it perfect for those who actually know what in the fuck they&rsquo;re looking at to dissect. The main draw of Monster is its villain and moral compass, but said villain immediately and permanently boils down to the writing sensibilities of the mentally underage who value aura over essence, and the moral compass is among the most vapid you can find. It tries to appear smart with a deep villain, only to have a villain so shallow and with an explanation and motivation so tangible as to be utterly thoughtless, and you really have to wonder how alien a real monster of a human would be to Urasawa if he ever met one. I mean, I&rsquo;m pretty messed up myself. You know, given how estranged and socially confused he is, I may just see myself in Johan a little bit. I might just be a really deep character myself. I mean, I emaciate myself with starvation, slash open my skin leaving scars up and down my body, and intensely want to die&mdash;have tried to die before and will again soon. That&rsquo;s not normal right? That&rsquo;s pretty monstrous, right? And, as it just so happens, I DIDN&rsquo;T HAVE TO GET BRAINWASHED BY FUCKING NAZIS TO GET THIS WAY, YOU NORMIE CUNT!"}},{node:{id:1469,title:"Monster Farm: Enbanseki no Himitsu",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1044/113641.jpg",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1044/113641l.jpg"}},list_status:{status:"dropped",score:2,num_episodes_watched:1,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2019-01-05T16:50:28+00:00",tags:[],comments:""}},{node:{id:31631,title:"Monster Hunter Stories: Ride On",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/76232.jpg",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/76232l.jpg"}},list_status:{status:"dropped",score:2,num_episodes_watched:1,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2018-12-06T18:16:37+00:00",tags:[],comments:""}},{node:{id:30307,title:"Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75104.jpg",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75104l.jpg"}},list_status:{status:"dropped",score:2,num_episodes_watched:3,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2017-12-23T06:51:41+00:00",tags:[],comments:""}},{node:{id:38022,title:"Monster Strike The Animation",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1415/101689.webp",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1415/101689l.webp"}},list_status:{status:"dropped",score:2,num_episodes_watched:1,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2019-08-07T23:11:11+00:00",tags:[],comments:""}},{node:{id:1941,title:"Moonlight Mile 1st Season: Lift Off",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1543/134894.jpg",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1543/134894l.jpg"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:2,num_episodes_watched:12,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2021-06-14T10:47:19+00:00",tags:[],comments:""}},{node:{id:2929,title:"Moonlight Mile 2nd Season: Touch Down",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/4265.jpg",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/4265l.jpg"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:2,num_episodes_watched:14,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2021-06-14T10:47:26+00:00",tags:[],comments:""}},{node:{id:39815,title:"More feat.

Please click the More button to the left of the score to see the Comments for my thoughts."],comments:"BECAUSE OF MY RECENT PROFILE UPDATES, THIS PIECE IS NOW OUTDATED. IT WILL BE REVISED AND EDITED SOON.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake one look at the Fours and you&rsquo;ll know I&rsquo;m not half bad at indulging myself, but take one look at My Favorites List and you&rsquo;ll know I&rsquo;m helplessly awful at indulging others. I can watch Gantz with popcorn in hand, banging my frail little neck to Super Shooter all day long, but the second someone like Shinichiro Watanabe&mdash;or worse, Hiroyuki Imaishi&mdash;puts their sense of humor in front of me expectingly, the first thing I&rsquo;ll do is check my watch. I&rsquo;m as picky of a watcher as I am an eater, and if something isn&rsquo;t at least loosely pandering to my taste at all times, said thing can kiss the prospect of reaching My Favorites List goodbye. However, there are some shows which reach such incredible heights I may let their less than appealing aspects slide as long as they&rsquo;re not abjectly terrible, ruining the good parts and making the show as a whole something to be called bad. If you inspect the section of My Favorites List between eight point five and nine point zero, you&rsquo;ll find a lot of these exceptions, shows whose lows should&rsquo;ve anchored them off the list altogether, but whose Herculean strengths powered them nearly to the top. Kazuya Tsurumaki&rsquo;s FLCL, Shinichiro Watanabe&rsquo;s Space\u2606Dandy, Samurai Champloo, and Cowboy Bebop, and Hiroyuki Imaishi&rsquo;s Kill la Kill and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann are the most emblematic of this phenomenon, and while every single entry in that range I mentioned could apply to this discussion on some level, those I just named explicitly are the most dramatic examples. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor some utterly baffling reason I cannot understand and will never be able to understand, Shinichiro Watanabe fancies himself more of a director&mdash;if not a producer&mdash;than a writer. His writing and the writing of those who take after him like Keiko Nobumoto is so incredibly mature, and believable, and emotionally resonant in a way which can rival the character writing of Hideaki Anno or Kouhei Kadono. Single episodes wherein he actually decides to imbue some feeling can tell more totalizing arcs and facilitate more meaningful developments than most entire shows can, and the three shows he directed which he decided to slip some of his writing in are on My Favorites List for those episodes, and those episodes alone.<br />\r\n- A Merry Companion is a Wagon in Space, Baby<br />\r\n- There&rsquo;s Always Tomorrow, Baby<br />\r\n- Even Vacuum Cleaners Fall in Love, Baby<br />\r\n- The Transfer Student is Dandy, Baby<br />\r\n- Lovers are Trendy, Baby<br />\r\n- An Other-Dimensional Tale, Baby<br />\r\n- Gamblers and Gallantry <br />\r\n- Misguided Miscreants<br />\r\n- Lullabies of the Lost<br />\r\n- Elegy of Entrapment <br />\r\n- Asteroid Blues<br />\r\n- Ballad of Fallen Angels <br />\r\n- Ganymede Elegy <br />\r\n- Black Dog Serenade <br />\r\n- Speak Like a Child<br />\r\n- Hard Luck Woman<br />\r\n- The Real Folk Blues<br />\r\nSimply put, these are some of the best episodes in the anime medium, and his shows even manage to boast equally ascendant quality when the reins are handed over, like when he gave Yuasa&rsquo;s team an episode of Space\u2606Dandy and they gave him Planets Are Living Things Too, Baby, or like when he gave Shuko Murase an episode of Samurai Champloo and he gave him THE BEST EPISODE OF ANIME EVER, OF ALL TIME, Misguided Miscreants (Part Two). That all said, these episodes are padded into twenty six episode long shows wherein the remaining run time is dedicated to whatever Watanabe and his team of writers and episodes directors thought would be some funny episodic shenanigans despite the fact I find most of it to be totally obnoxious. Its not I think any one thing in any of his shows are outright bad, but much of them are pandering a brand of comedy to an audience I&rsquo;m clearly not a part of, and some are completely esoteric in nature like I Can&rsquo;t Be the Only One, Baby. However, after I get into the groove of watching these shows, I start to come around and enjoy the vast majority of them having already come to terms with the fact this is Watanabe&rsquo;s style, and I just have to shut up and accept it. Cowboy Bebop is higher than the other two because it&rsquo;s antics are much more subdued than theirs, and there&rsquo;s even some of the full bore comedy episodes in all three which I can admit to be pretty golden, as The Art of Altercation is absolutely hilarious and the ending to The War of Undies and Vests, Baby beat Mugi from K-On!! stealing Mio&rsquo;s strawberry as the most I&rsquo;ve ever laughed watching anime. Though, at the end of the day, all three of these shows had the potential to be my top three favorite anime.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGainax/Trigger shows are much the same, but worse, way, way, way worse because while Watanabe traps his wackiness within tight episodic cases, these creators take every pleasure in installing their senses of humor as running gags, if not wholesale building them into the plot. As I&rsquo;ve written in the tags, FLCL has Evangelion tier character writing, but it also has a minutes long segment with the South Park art style. Why? Because Tsurumaki and the boys were watching it lately in the office and thought it&rsquo;d be funny, and you know who else was in that office? Imaishi.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHiroyuki Imaishi is one of my favorite anime directors out there, and this is despite the fact I utterly hate his direction. Space Patrol Luluco was great because the whole thing was one big meta breaker so nothing mattered either way you&rsquo;d have it, Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt was fine because he was only in the directors chair half the time, so when he did take over it had awesomely bracing impact while never overstaying it&rsquo;s welcome, which is the same case with episode one of Re:Cutey Honey, but Sex &amp; Violence with Machspeed and especially Dead Leaves get seriously hard to watch at times. Frankly, Imaishi is an animal, and he needs a leash to be comprehensible. Luckily, Kazuki Nakashima is there to chain him down with his genus scripts, concepts, and themes as well as his unmatched dialogue. When confined to a solid script and not merely left to his own dangerously creative creative devices, Imaishi effectively becomes a (somehow) better Tetsur\u014d Araki. His haphazard madness becomes fluidly dynamic, prepossessingly epic, and infectiously memorable cinematography, and his stupid, sometimes even gross and scatological artwork becomes meticulously framed genius to bolster Nakashima&rsquo;s incessant theming. That said, like Watanabe shows, ImaishixNakashima shows are long. They have room for some foolery, and Imaishi will take whatever room he can get. Be it Team Gurren having to overcome a bathhouse full of big breasted Gainax references and literally finger each other in the ass to get a glimpse into the womens&rsquo; bath or The Elite Four having to take an episode off to fight an endless string of astronomically esoteric culture jokes of ear piercingly voiced throwaway characters during the Tri-City Schools Raid Trip, Imaishi will use every available second to cram in some of his nonsense diluting the otherwise genus narrative and theming the show boasts. I knew Promare could never reach the emotional, character developmental, and thematic heights of Kill la Kill and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann being a movie, but I also knew I may very well love it miles more than the previous legends given the fact Imaishi wouldn&rsquo;t be allotted that time to get himself off. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd I was almost right. Promare has the focus I always wanted this team to operate under. But before I can even properly discuss the succulent goodness under the surface and how it excelled in places and faulted in others, I have GOT to talk about that stunning surface! Immediately upon the film&rsquo;s expectation obliterating opening act, I was inundated by a barrage of some of the most engaging animated visual art I&rsquo;ve yet to witness in my entire life. Promare is an art design spectacle capable of dropping the jaw of any fan of anime, and anyone with even the slightest droplet of appreciation for the medium of animation would be remiss giving Promare an less than a six out of ten&mdash;on their scale, not mine&mdash;on the artwork and technical innovation on display alone. The color palette is irreplaceably unique, and despite it being nothing my style, I was deeply, deeply in love with it before I even knew what was happening. The character designs are as sharp and memorable as any other Trigger/Gainax work, and Sushio&rsquo;s animation personified them to the level of aesthetic perfection as seen in Kiznaiver. The mecha design is classic Koyama, and the pseudo-cel shaded CG complimented his work to a tee and made the integration as a whole far more smooth than any clean-cut 3D design ever has for any mecha from any designer in any anime. And Imaishi. Went. Nuts. I remember watching Kill la Kill for the fist time and being like, huh, Imaishi really seems to have a new thing for rotation, doesn&rsquo;t he? During the opening episodes before he started letting episode directors take the reins, he absolutely littered the screen with CG character models and 3DCG landscapes just so he could throw that camera around as much as livingly possible, and Promare chains this fixation of his to the side of a rocket, fits the cone with a spiral drill, and launched it to pierce the god damn heavens. In the hands of anyone&mdash;and I mean ANYONE&mdash;else, this film would be a downright nauseating train wreck of incomprehensible spinning and flashing to a seizure inducing degree, but in the hands of Imaishi its an unforgettable statement of ambitious cinema which will surely go down in the history of the medium as a revolutionary step forward of the potential of CG animation. Both times I saw it in theaters, the opening act had me braced to my seat, with my entire body tense and my eyes wide open not daring to miss even a millisecond and break Imaishi&rsquo;s never-ending flow, and while the film never reached that level of sheer directorial genius again, the final fight with Krazor X was nearly as shocking to the system. Even with the CG being the highlight on a technical level, the hand drawn animation was equally awesome. The best scene of the movie was Lio&rsquo;s awakening into the dragon with Kakusei&mdash;which means awakening by the way&mdash;blasting in the background thanks to the sakuga cut of him erupting out of a volcano while literally, physically becoming the volcano being possibly the most badass single thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my entire life with an unforgettable color aesthetic. And speaking of the music, Sawano also went nuts as well. His work certainly did not live up to Kill la Kill, but that show had the best anime soundtrack he&rsquo;s ever composed and one of the best of all time, so I&rsquo;d say being worse than the best is no failure. Nexus was amazing and lived up to Light Your Heart Up perfectly, Ashes was beautiful and elegant on the level of Binary Star and nearly I Want to Know, Gallant Ones was a hype building headbanger on the level of Hill of Sorrow and nearly DOA, Inferno was yet another entry to the Sawano Hall of Fame on the level of The Reluctant Heroes and nearly Layers, even if not even getting close to Bios, Zero Eclipse, or Before My Body is Dry, and I hope to god he does more work with the artist Superfly because Kakusei was the closest of the Promare OST to reach the heights of Kill la Kill&rsquo;s by being a Blumenkranz inspiration almost as good as the genuine article. All things considered, Promare was an audio/visual delight calling out for the ages.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut again, of course, the truly important discussion is the one to have under the surface. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI guess I&rsquo;ll just rip the band-aid off now and say it does not look like Promare is going to be making My Favorites List. Theres a lot of ways I can approach this discussion, and I&rsquo;m at a loss which one I should assume, so I&rsquo;m just going to stay true to my roots and ramble.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOut of the seventy four anime concurrently on My Favorites List at the time I&rsquo;m writing this piece, thirty three of them are films, not TV series. That&rsquo;s 45% of the list; that&rsquo;s a lot. The reason for this, if I had to oversimplify it, is films are easier to get right. Films are shorter, tighter, and easier to watch than whole series, and while a series which devotes every second of itself to what it does best and what I like it the most for can reach heights even a second by second perfect movie could never even dream of reaching, my favorite anime of all time for example, the odds of that happening&mdash;or even being able to happen&mdash;are so helplessly low you may as well consider it to be a case of luck whenever it does. Though, at the same time, a movie can also ruin itself just as easily for the exact same reason. After all, Paradise Lost can flush the potential of it&rsquo;s series&rsquo; narrative down the toilet as fast as The End of Evangelion can make it&rsquo;s series&rsquo; narrative a legend. Notice all but one of the entries in that exceptional eight point five to nine point zero range I mentioned earlier are TV series. This is because they have the time to mess up, subjectively at least, while still maintaining a high status. Take Paprika for example. That film would be near perfect, but just because the chase sequence leading into the film&rsquo;s climax is a tiny bit overlong, its consigned to the bottom of the list. I mean, hell, Perfect Blue didn&rsquo;t even make Honorable Mentions because it had so much damn running. At an hour and three minutes when you see Me-Mania walking towards Mima from down the hall, the film was an eight point one at absolute minimum, and by credits roll less than twenty mere minutes later, the thought of even giving it a six point five out of pity was already a long shot. Movies, to say the very least, are a double edged sword, and while I expected the focus of Promare alone to make it a nine point three at minimum with no ceiling for a predicted maximum, it&rsquo;s lack of individuality and plot relevant comedy seem to be enough to hold it&rsquo;s genus theming and revolutionary production values off My Favorites List. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, the plot relevant comedy thing I&rsquo;ve gone over more than enough already. The naming scheme thing was whatever, and Deus Ex Machina had the theater audience&mdash;if not me&mdash;roaring with laughter both times I went to see it, but overall, this amounts to about two percent of the reason Promare fell short of the list thanks to the reason I thought: Nakashima kept things dense and did not allow Imaishi to screw around. The remaining ninety eight percent are devoted to the lack of individuality, the issue I never even saw coming as potential. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPromare&rsquo;s lack of individuality is something&mdash;having been so surprised and confused by it&mdash;I had a very hard time nailing down the cause of and processing the effect of, but after as much deliberation as I could fit into my hellishly busy life, I think it boils down to time, and by extension, repetition. Recently, I went to watch the Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann recap movies. They were in the newest Aniplex rerelease of the blu rays, so after having owned that set and ignored those films for years, I decided why not. Actually, I figured they&rsquo;d be great. After all, the first half of this piece is dedicated to me bitching about my favorites shows not being consistent exactly how I selfishly wished them to be, and if I was so committed to the idea Promare would beat out Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and Kill la Kill simply by being a movie naturally more tightly constructed even if it never reached their emotional heights, why would the recap films not hold the same pros? Well, because Nakashima&rsquo;s storytelling&mdash;not writing in general&mdash;shines with time, and by extension, repetition. Watching Lagann-hen, I nearly got outright angry within minutes. I could write a whole separate essay detailing the differences, my issues with them, and my issues with the film as a whole, but the prime example was the fact the montage at the movie&rsquo;s outset included the birth of Dayakka and Kiyoh&rsquo;s child. How disrespectful it was to sidestep such a touching milestone in the history of such rich characters notwithstanding, what made that development so good in the original show was their child was the millionth ape. This is not the case in the film, or at least its not suggested to be, because while the side characters were resigned to the montage, Simon and Nia&rsquo;s scenes obviously weren&rsquo;t, so when Nia is eventually possessed by the anti-spiral it comes out of nowhere, whereas in the TV series it was triggered by an already emotionally climactic development and thusly imbued with astronomically more gravitas. While the nature of this example has absolutely nothing to do with any of my issues with Promare, it was the first moment I realized maybe I wouldn&rsquo;t want to cut down ImaishixNakashima shows as much as I assumptively thought I would. Nakashima takes repetition. What makes Ryuko and Satsuki&rsquo;s dual transformation sequence in Kill la Kill episode twenty two as cathartic and blood boiling hype as it is, isn&rsquo;t the fact you&rsquo;re seeing it. After all, we&rsquo;ve been watching those same transformation sequence since episode three. What makes it legendary is them doing it together after all the occasions they were doing it previously against one another. Nakashima takes time. What makes the King Kittan Giga Drill Break as cathartic and blood boiling hype as it is, isn&rsquo;t the fact its happening. After all, nothing has explicitly suggested you needed a spiral drill to use spiral power. What makes it legendary is the fact Kittan was introduced as a literal, in-universe Kamina wannabe and was masterfully developed into one of the most respectable, likable, badass heroes in the show and dies heartbreakingly in an unforgettable blaze of glory. Now I know what you&rsquo;re thinking. I already said this wasn&rsquo;t an issue for me. I already said I knew Promare would never reach these heights, so what do these heights have to do with the original point? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIts the fact these heights AND THEIR BUILDUP are what define their respective shows. Promare is written by Kazuki Nakashima, but first and foremost its directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi. The film is always moving, and while every significant step up it took was one I enjoyed taking alongside, I cannot deny the fact we were sprinting up that staircase. In a phrase, there&rsquo;s all the heights in the world, but there&rsquo;s no climb there to make them feel worth it. Imaishi could&rsquo;ve given Nakashima some breathing room, as I&rsquo;m sure a playwright like himself would have absolutely no issue writing a slower paced film with only three or four monumental moments where they&rsquo;re made meaningful by the lead in between them, but we all know Imaishi would&rsquo;ve ripped that script to shreds and thrown it directly in the garbage, literally, if you know their history together. I had assumed the heights were what mattered and a film still able to cram them in would be enough to bring my predictions to life and get Promare that nine point three, but I somehow had let the realization those heights only gained their depth via the building blocks which preceded them slip my mind. Nakashima&rsquo;s impactful, soul-stirring dialogue was almost a double edged sword given the fact it reminded me more of his other epic personalities than it did define any one character who spoke the line in actuality, no matter how invigorated it made me in the moment. And that&rsquo;s the thing. Promare, concurrently, is about what I had predicted it to be, but in retrospect is where it dramatically looses value. I mentioned this earlier, but Lio&rsquo;s awakening is incredible and is as much of a hype beast as Kamina&rsquo;s original Giga Drill Break. The opening act I kept praising was even more visually stimulating and stunningly bracing than Ryuko and Satsuki&rsquo;s first fight, and just as much as their second. But Lio&rsquo;s awakening wasn&rsquo;t preceded by the most inspiring character driven plot developments I&rsquo;ve ever seen or accompanied by the most tragically unexpected character death in anime history, nor was the opening act preceded by the most unforgettable character introductions I&rsquo;ve ever seen or accompanied by the single most legendary insert song in anime history. Despite the bones of this film being made of steel, there&rsquo;s no meat on them. And what hurts this reality all the more is the film&rsquo;s art design. I know I praised it to high heaven, and I maintain said praise, but on a metatextual level separate from the film itself, the character designs and mecha designs both further Promare&rsquo;s lack of individuality. So many characters look, act, or look AND act like characters from Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann or Kill la Kill but don&rsquo;t have the depth of identity their comparative counterparts do, and the Galo de Lion&rsquo;s mecha design just IS the TTGL itself. The implications of the reference itself are awesome and heavy as hell, but its still a reference they build into the plot, and as I complained about to no end at the beginning of this stupidly long diatribe, why would you ever build a reference to another story into the plot of your new one? All these little visual similarities (oddly juxtaposed with the unequivocally unique surroundings) add up over the course of this film until the only thing letting me remember Galo said, &ldquo;My burning firefighter&rsquo;s soul,&rdquo; instead of Kamina is the fact I know Kamina wasn&rsquo;t a firefighter. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nJust now, I said there was no meat on the bones of Promare, and that wasn&rsquo;t exactly true in it&rsquo;s entirety, as the one thing which matched my gargantuan expectations aside from Nakashima&rsquo;s base dialogue, was his usual succulent theming. Promare is probably the most timely piece of media I&rsquo;ve ever seen which isn&rsquo;t immersion breaking or inappropriate. Its about rage, burning rage, and what it says about the furnaces it blazes within: humans. I don&rsquo;t know where you live, dear reader, but I live in America, the land of the free, and the home of the mass shooters. Now I&rsquo;m sure no one needs me, the paragon of poor mental health, lecturing them about the human condition&rsquo;s deteriorating ability to manage stress and anxiety in an oppressively stigmatized, systematized, polarized society, but I feel like its reasonable to recognize just how high judgments are and just how thoroughly it effects our worldview as individuals. This is especially true when you&rsquo;re on the fringes of what the human psyche can take, because you&rsquo;ll either end up like me, hating yourself, or end up like the mass shooters, hating everyone else. Promare tackles the latter, because its unfortunately more common and miles more impactful to the mass consciousness. And yes, I would argue on behalf of the former sentence even though suicide rates are obviously higher than mass shooting rates, because as someone well acquainted with suicide in concept and practice, I feel strongly most people killing themselves aren&rsquo;t doing so because they specifically hate themselves, but this is totally irrelevant to Promare. Again, Promare tackles the latter, people who are frustrated with society and simply don&rsquo;t have an outlet to vent themselves in risk of stepping outside the bounds of acceptable normalcy and being ostracized for it who hold their emotions back until they explode with gunfire, or in Promare&rsquo;s case, actual fire. The Burnish Flame and the Promare themselves have much the same metaphoric implications as the Minotaur from Tekkon Kinkreet, but whereas that movie was going in more of a Texhnolyze direction with it, the Promare feel like they&rsquo;d jibe better with Casshern Sins. The Minotaur was there to be ugly and scary and tell you that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve got percolating underneath your skin, that&rsquo;s what your soul looks like, but then at the end when you see the Promare leave back to their dimension they&rsquo;re portrayed rather beautifully and elegantly, seeming to be more of the thought these feelings aren&rsquo;t meant to be ashamed of or more importantly afraid of&hellip;which is really comforting. The colors are bright and emotional, and you hear what almost sounds like innocent children playing. Needless to say, this was incredibly touching and imbued the film with the thematic backbone I expected which, among other things, makes Kazuki Nakashima the best anime writer out there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrankly, I&rsquo;m honestly just relieved I got to see the damn thing. I&rsquo;ll most certainly have killed myself in the next six years it&rsquo;ll take for them to make another collaborative work, at least if this release pattern continues, but I&rsquo;m happy to say I have no regrets letting Promare be my last. It was a great film and a true joy to watch, and while it didn&rsquo;t touch me as deeply and invigorate me as viscerally as Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann or move me as personally and empower me as genuinely as Kill la Kill, it did impress, delight, and entertain me as much as both the former ever could&mdash;and more to the original point&mdash;on a much more consistent basis than either, even if said joy and memorability are ultimately hijacked by my stronger memories of it&rsquo;s predecessors whom it bears so much unnecessary resemblance to. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for reading."}},{node:{id:39991,title:"Promare: Galo-hen",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1369/108826.jpg",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1369/108826l.jpg"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:6,num_episodes_watched:1,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2022-02-19T22:12:27+00:00",tags:[],comments:""}},{node:{id:40313,title:"Promare: Lio-hen",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1289/108896.webp",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1289/108896l.webp"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:6,num_episodes_watched:1,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2022-02-19T22:14:33+00:00",tags:[],comments:""}},{node:{id:1027,title:"Psychic Force",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1091/94164.webp",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1091/94164l.webp"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:2,num_episodes_watched:2,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2019-03-31T02:19:19+00:00",tags:[],comments:""}},{node:{id:1767,title:"Psycho Diver: Mashou Bosatsu",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1504/141312.jpg",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1504/141312l.jpg"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:2,num_episodes_watched:1,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2019-03-08T23:48:04+00:00",tags:[],comments:""}},{node:{id:13601,title:"Psycho-Pass",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1314/142015.webp",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1314/142015l.webp"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:9,num_episodes_watched:22,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2021-05-29T08:10:40+00:00",tags:["My thoughts on this anime were too long for the tags.

Even using the word &ldquo;praise&rdquo; is a bit of a stretch, though, since I have yet to write about or expound my thoughts on the show in any way, but merely giving it a high score on a public page was apparently enough to have people on my case for years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPsycho-Pass is astronomically successful and beloved in none but the mainstream eye, and the deeper you delve into this thoroughly elitist community of big-headed young people and their pretentious opinions, the more fiery the hatred you&rsquo;re likely to encounter for Psycho-Pass. What makes the show so disagreeable to these people, if I had to use my wealth of experience talking with the most extreme of them on /a/ to put words in their mouths, is the fact it isn&rsquo;t intellectually dense enough to warrant such an artfully grandiose and conceptually overwrought presentation. The more time you spend not merely consuming anime, but learning about the creative processes and industry players behind them, you stop watching Bones shows with awe, stop perceiving Ghibli as the studio with the highest production values, and you subconsciously begin conditioning yourself to only appreciate true craft and competitive technical prowess behind the few works which actually boasts them. Production IG has always been the most critically revered, professionally respected animation studio in Japan for good and obvious reason, and Psycho-Pass was their tour de force which set the unbeatable (and arguably still unbeaten) standard for the 2010s. The lavish animation is astounding, the crisp score is produced exquisitely, the meticulously detailed sound design is mixed perfectly, the CG integration was groundbreaking for the time and still beautifully composited to this day, the hand-drawn background art was unprecedented for modern TV animation and are hardly matched&mdash;if at all&mdash;by any anime outside their purview, and any other facet of the unflinchingly consistent production which I won&rsquo;t bore you by listing can only be summarized by the word superior. What really dropped the jaws of the critics, though, wasn&rsquo;t the fact Production IG made another technical masterpiece, they&rsquo;d been doing that ever since their TV debut, but the sheer impress warranted by the reality the team behind it wasn&rsquo;t the same one which made those prior envelope pushers. In the 90s, Production IG made a legendary sequence of films under the small and tightly knit yet historical and peerless Team Oshii, and when they began recruiting more legends not already among their ranks and training younger and newer animation staff with exceptional in-house commitment, they earned themselves the man-power to start churning out equally superlative TV anime. Built by those who the veterans brought up and crowned by they themselves, anime like Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Guardian of the Sacred Spirit, and Eden of the East were immediately among the greatest achievements in made-for-TV animation which distinguished Production IG legends who never got to make a full name for themselves as a part of Team Oshii like Takeda Y\u016bsuke, who&rsquo;s award winning art direction has since become deservedly famous, but more to the point, what made them true masterpieces was not only their epic visual presentation, but their unequivocally brilliant, dense, and maturely meaningful creative direction. Original creator &amp; chief writer and director Kenji Kamiyama, co-director Masayuki Yoshihara, and co-writer Sh\u014dtar\u014d Suga are the trifecta of geniuses who made these achievements possible, and none of them, nor the art directors and animators breathing life into their vision, had a hand in the creation of Psycho-Pass.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile skeptics aren&rsquo;t wrong in claiming the turn of the decade marked the beginning of the end of the anime industry&mdash;and I appreciate the irony of me, of all people, calling anyone else a skeptic&mdash;that decline wasn&rsquo;t felt by the outstanding studios which could take it. As production committees became more and more cynical, corporatized, and harmfully frugal, studios who had the attention of the masses like A-1 Pictures,  Studio Bones, and most hilariously, Studio Ghibli all began their decent immediately, selling out to production committees, contracting themselves entirely to manga magazines, and literally filing for closure because their founder is an anachronistic reptile who thinks a strong handshake is going to secure animators a position for life and a studio the budget it needs respectively, and even historically dignified studios like Madhouse underwent bankruptcy because Masao Maruyama didn&rsquo;t care about the debt his budgets were obviously accruing so long as he enabled visionaries the likes of Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Satoshi Kon, Mamoru Hosoda, Rintaro, and even the young and unproven Takeshi Koike to create their art at the highest production values possible because he&rsquo;s a god damn hero. However, Sunrise kept their stature by committing not only to the continuation of their beloved, classic, anime original franchises for which they owned the IP, but by taking advantage of their distribution rights to profit massively off associated merchandise; Kyoto Animation kept their stature by committing their financial security to their own production desk and personally training every single incoming animator to ensure the unwavering quality of their projects despite their small staff and physical, geographical dissociation to the resources and connections every other studio headquartered in the Tokyo metroplex had and has access to; and Production IG kept their stature by committing to both, and reorganizing accordingly. Hiroyuki Okiura, Toshiyuki Inoue, Tetsuya Nishio, Shinya Ohira, Mitsuo Iso, Masashi And\u014d, either Hashimoto, you name it, Production IG has the best of the best, but relegating the best of the best to gacha game commercials like every other studio has done with their talent is simply not their MO. While their second-wave staff I discussed earlier was now becoming just as known and skilled as their predecessors, with names as distinguished as Kazuto Nakazawa, Naoyoshi Shiotani, and Kyouji Asano, Ishikawa was paying attention, and to preserve his pantheon of artistic genius and unmatched production capabilities, he made the ambitious decision to entrust the second-wave staff who, today, make up IG&rsquo;s in-house TV animation team which spearheads projects like B: The Beginning and even the occasional theatrical production like Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System with the creation and execution of their next big original IP while their older, more legendary collection of staff was being isolated and concentrated within a team of in-house animators set to work exclusively on theatrical productions such as A Letter to Momo and Sarusuberi: Miss Hokusai. By cherry picking their rightfully renowned veterans and placing them in a small group reminiscent of the same Team Oshii from which they all made themselves famous, they could continue churning out the awe inspiring works of flawlessly excessive, hyper-realistic animation which long since solidified Production IG as the best, while also having the younger yet beyond competent team tackling high-brow adaptations and original IPs alike to put good shit on TV and keep the studio afloat in the new industry landscape. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, then, who replaced the Kamiyama Team? Kyouji Asano, a young animator who was hired on as an in-between animator during the production cycle for Jin-Roh, yet who was so outwardly talented, he was trusted with key animation on not only Kamiyama&rsquo;s Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, but Mamoru Oshii&rsquo;s Innocence, was appointed animation director and led a collection of staff much like himself, young talent who proved themselves as in-between and key animation staff working as a part of IG&rsquo;s B Team during the early 2000s era of the Kamiyama Team. They worked in cooperation with veteran staff to produce works with the technical quality of Le Chevalier D&rsquo;Eon, Real Drive, and even Shinreigari: GHOST HOUND, but they really showed what they were capable of with projects they handled all by themselves. This sentence is pure speculation on my part, but personally, I think Sengoku Basara and the discovery of hidden talent among their younger ranks the likes of Ryota Furukawa and Arifumi Imai was the proof of concept for Psycho-Pass, and ultimately, the creation of WIT Studio. The fact these young people could achieve such spectacle on their own artistic rights was proof of Production IG&rsquo;s exceptional in-house training, and they made Psycho-Pass a true beauty of animation juggling mangaka Akira Amano&rsquo;s sharp character designs and the director&rsquo;s unrelentingly ambitious angles, movements, and martial choreography. Speaking of the creative staff, this is where things get relevant. Everything up to this point was just explaining why Psycho-Pass has production values worthy of the legendary brand Production IG built despite not being made by the same technical staff and headed by the same creative leads, but I only did so, so I could now detail why it doesn&rsquo;t quite have the density of the Kamiyama shows weaved under the gloss. Elevated to the director&rsquo;s chair was Naoyoshi Shiotani, a veteran in-between animator and newly minted animation director who showed just how distinct of a cinematic vision he had when he turned heads with the iconic imagery and epic framing of Blood+&rsquo;s third OP, and brought in to write the original scenario and script the series was Urobuchi Gen, who had recently made a big name for himself in the industry as a shocking new writer who challenged norms and betrayed expectations: Gen The Butcher. Butch Gen, as he&rsquo;s known, is a controversial writer for many reasons, and while many of these reasons are as overly sensitive and purely subjective as you&rsquo;d expect, others are admittedly genuine and sometimes worth calling into question his actual skill as a writer. All the pretentious pseudo-intellectuals you&rsquo;ll find decrying Psycho-Pass will state its exposition is too flat and fundamentally superfluous, and while anyone thinking with even a shred of logical rationale will roll their eyes at these complaints, acknowledging the fact the characters are police officers taking part in procedural operations which require every little detail to be laid out for them to analyze, the individuals spouting this nonsense will never concede this point because, at the end of the day, IG veterans under the Kamiyama Team made Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, a police procedural just like Psycho-Pass which doesn&rsquo;t even try to use its debriefing scenes to explain away the plot and only ever does so via subtle, often thematically charged character dialogue. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAre you beginning to see what I&rsquo;m getting at now? <br />\r\nThere&rsquo;s more examples.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMakishima is very transparent about being driven purely by philosophy. He targets the hyper-oats not because he has a personal vendetta against the socialist farming system or a particular hatred for wheat, but simply because executing this targeted attack is the most logistically foolproof way to cripple the Sibyl System, his moral counterpart. On the other hand, in the case of Eden of the East, Takizawa Akira&rsquo;s actions are driven by his meticulously characterized personality and emotional disposition as opposed to a detached ideology explained to the audience. He mobilizes the NEETs not because he&rsquo;s categorically deduced them to be the premiere hacking force on the face of the planet, but simply because he personally wants to prove NEETs can contribute to society in a productive manner given the right circumstances and resources. Makishima explains his philosophy, the thematic message of the series, and acts on that explanation to prove the point the series is transparently attempting to make, whereas Akira merely stands as the honestly portrayed and unflinchingly realistic character he is, living and breathing not by a stated theme, but by his own empathetic human emotions, yet when he acts upon these feelings, he and his actions come to embody a greater socioeconomic issue which the series had always been speaking to deep within its nuanced subtext. Don&rsquo;t let me sell short the maturity and tact of Psycho-Pass completely, though, because Butch Gen absolutely nails every other development for which his characters are destined. Kogami deserting the MWPSB and killing Makishima with a revolver, not a Dominator, for the sole sake of his rage&mdash;which thusly serves as un understated proof of Makishima&rsquo;s argument that conviction cannot exist without some degree of anarchy, and certainly without the determinism held under Sibyl&mdash;almost directly mirrors the brilliantly portrayed inner contradiction of mankind displayed in Guardian of the Sacred Spirit when Jiguro took responsibility for Balsa&rsquo;s safety not because he actually felt the need or duty to do so, but in an unfairly human turn of motivations, simply because he would&rsquo;ve been petrified with guilt for not obliging the final wish of his friend, despite being openly annoyed his friend would even think to involve him in such espionage knowing Jiguro would be too selfless to refuse the potentially lifelong assignment of protecting his innocent daughter from the political turmoil he stirred up, completely separate from Jiguro and his flourishing career as a royal guard which he would surely be forfeiting. It&rsquo;s all a conversation of subtlety, and while the defense for Psycho-Pass is undeniable, the comparison is there&mdash;perhaps not visually, but certainly under the surface&mdash;and that&rsquo;s what elitists hate about it. I repeat, it isn&rsquo;t intellectually dense enough to warrant such an artfully grandiose and conceptually overwrought presentation. It&rsquo;s praised so highly yet doesn&rsquo;t even come close to matching its predecessors on paper despite matching them entirely in animation, and as these elitists will happily quote, &ldquo;I reject the notion, to you and our viewers, that I am at all cynical about this show. I believe I&rsquo;m just responding as objectively as can be to a show that&rsquo;s being presented before me, and it&rsquo;s not my fault if I&rsquo;m comparing it to other things I&rsquo;ve consumed in my life, and it stacks up better or worse than others of them.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut, however it may compare to whatever else, I proudly adore Psycho-Pass and always will. At times, the show can aim itself at a target audience younger than I would&#039;ve preferred, and while I&rsquo;d give most of the show a solid Eight, with a few episodes in the Helmet Arc which I&#039;d even go so far as to give Sixes or Sevens individually, episodes seventeen through twenty two are all perfect Tens, and they completely and totally relive the glory of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex spiritually succeeded in the modern age. Yes, Psycho-Pass wears its heart on its shoulder, but that doesn&rsquo;t make such a heart any less valuable nor diminish what it has to say. Psycho-Pass is the smartest, most daring dystopia I can name with classic literature notwithstanding, as no author other than Urobuchi Gen has mustered up the courage and developed the intelligence to offer a conclusion to their stories other than the simpleminded, illogical, and cowardly decision to destroy the corrupt system at hand and return society to its roots. Psycho-Pass knows Sibyl is a double edged sword, and while it&rsquo;s morally indefensible, its benefits are undeniable. Nearly every single dystopia out there offers anywhere from a mildly interesting to a totally groundbreaking conceptual setup only to invariably conclude itself by tearing everything down after exposing its dark secrets because, &ldquo;Hooray! Humanism!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s childish and self-censoring to the point of being downright stupid within its own context. Do the self-righteous bibliophiles behind these stories know the horrific shit we&rsquo;ve pulled all throughout history to progress humankind in the real world? You can&rsquo;t just stand atop your soap box refusing to accept any advancements which happen to challenge your principles even a little bit, because if you do, and we all do, society will never evolve. Urobuchi is Japanese. He knows if two whole cities of his country had to get vaporized off the face of the planet just for the sake of testing infant military weaponry and establishing the gridlock of mutually assured destruction which unequivocally deterred a third World War initiated by the United States and the Soviet Union, a handful of people have to get gored by the Dominators to ensure the safety, sanity, and happiness of the other residents living under Sibyl. Keep in mind the fact we only see the people who are scraped around, absentmindedly oppressed, and sometimes unfairly murdered by Sibyl because Psycho-Pass is a police procedural. People don&rsquo;t call the MWPSB&rsquo;s Crime Investigation Department because they have good news. The series focuses on the criminals who slip through the cracks and trusts you have the emotional maturity to appreciate the fact there are millions of other people you see on the street who live like Kings and Queens under Sibyl&rsquo;s purview. Forget the revolutionary resource management and universal high standard of living, Sibyl gives people like Akane a healthy life with a fulfilling job were she can legitimately contribute to an observably productive society despite being effectively forced into the position, and it also gives people like Akane&rsquo;s friend, Kaori, a husband who she&rsquo;s genuinely compatible and in love with despite having been matched by what was tantamount to an arranged marriage. The Sibyl system lives up to its mythological name and believably portrays a society smarter than our own in every way, and one I would much rather live in not only because it would finally let me die, killing me for being fucked in the head, but because even if I was normal, I&rsquo;d be honored to live under the thumb of a sociopathic hivemind of inhuman oracles if it meant getting to bask in the glory of the modern paradise they created. Psycho-Pass is the fullest swing of the double edged sword, Urobuchi Gen, and the fact the wielder was the technically unmatched pantheon of an animation studio, Production IG, made it a true sight to behold and a permanent installment on My Favorites List, whether it could hold a candle to the Kamiyama projects or not.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for reading."}},{node:{id:23281,title:"Psycho-Pass 2",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1197/100616.webp",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1197/100616l.webp"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:1,num_episodes_watched:11,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2020-12-02T00:47:23+00:00",tags:["An insult to the OG.

Texhnolyze approaches this ideology from a broad perspective by carefully constructing flawed characters to make examples out of, making sure the sum of the cast accounts for every brand of human there is. That way, no one can escape the crushing message of the show should they dare to even think it over. \u014cnishi is an example to those who let themselves be enslaved by duty &amp; honor; Eriko is an example to those who let themselves be enslaved by passion and academia; Shinji is an example to those who let themselves be enslaved by society and class; Hal is an example to those who let themselves be enslaved by relationships; and of course, Yoshii is an example to those who let themselves be enslaved by philosophy and the abstract. Shigurui, on the other hand, takes a much less intellectually ambitious route to make the point, or at least a more direct version of it, and focuses in on the specific constructs relevant to lordship, servitude, and their long list of social decorations with which individuals can distinguish themselves and find meaning in.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you watch the members of the Kogan Dojo commit the appalling atrocities which they do over the course of the series, you bear witness to the pathetic underbelly of the so-called honor which they claim to hold devotion to and strive toward, and there comes a point where you see the nihilistic implications of it all, again, in a way which really harkens back to the deep, dark implications of Texhnolyze. I still remember the first time I saw the truly staggering ending of episode two and just how stunned it left me feeling. I was dumbstruck, reeling at the reality of what I had just beheld. Kogan was mad, clinically insane and delusional, yet Irako, Fujiki, Ushimata, and all the other lost and naive pupils of the Kogan Dojo willingly followed him knowing full well what he was. They&rsquo;re content to compete in this fiendish game of who can kill who in the most ruthless fashion to win the intangible title he holds and the womb of his poor daughter who he himself lusts over, and they brutalize each other and countless innocents only to then be brutalized themselves by the masters they seek to emulate for no admirable reason. And all for what? What do they gain for their efforts? Honor by decree, and the worthless pride which comes with it&mdash;just two make believe ideas men use as an excuse to live with some sense of purpose, no matter how fleeting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, yeah, Texhnolyze in a nutshell.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut then, you may ask, why didn&rsquo;t Shigurui&rsquo;s thematic depth, smart writing, and beautiful aesthetics earn it a higher spot on My Favorites List, and if you&rsquo;re me, the answer is seriously obnoxious, because what holds it down is something which hasn&rsquo;t held other anime down before. It&rsquo;s the simple fact this adaptation is an incomplete anime which doesn&rsquo;t cover the entire narrative. So, the real question then becomes, what makes Shigurui so uniquely susceptible to what&rsquo;s normally a non-issue? It&rsquo;s the fact the story only makes its point in full at the end, the ending which the anime never got to, yet the ending to which I&rsquo;ve been spoiled to. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, though. Shigurui is perfectly fulfilling as it stands, boasting beautiful artwork, nail-biting imagery, mature characterization parallel to the expertly realized historical setting, and a tone so thick and totalizing, only Director Hiroshi Hamasaki could ever have hoped to deliver on it with such a deft mastery of cinema. However, the actual thematic gravity of the work is only demonstrated by the ending of episode two, the devotion of Kogan&rsquo;s followers in the face of his crystal clear insanity and the wretched truths of human nature to which said devotion implies, and the remainder of the show ceases to restate or expand on this message at all. You could argue it didn&rsquo;t need to do so having already made the point, and to that I&rsquo;d agree, but the ending of the manga is far more inexorably bleak, despairingly poignant, and unrelentingly hopeless than the ending of episode two ever was, and I know without a shadow of a doubt&mdash;given the fact the original manga&rsquo;s authorship began during its run and concluded years after its conclusion&mdash;Shigurui&rsquo;s finale was inspired by the crushing moral of Texhnolyze, even if the conceit of the story wasn&rsquo;t and an ending of such a nature was always planned. I mean, if you read the final chapters of Shigurui while listening to Walking Through the Empty Age, it would fit like a glove. Trust me. I&rsquo;ve done it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen they finally resume the events of the present day at the end of the story and continue the match with which the series began, Fujiki wins, as we all knew he would, but the crazed Lord who organized this hellish sport then demanded he behead Irako&rsquo;s corpse, for sadism and depravity&rsquo;s sake alone. Still as naive as he ever was, Fujiki cannot even begin to fathom the cruel machinations at work behind his horrific fate. He is truly disgusted by the idea of disrespecting the body and memory of his rival, his brother, but as he stands frozen in thought, the Lord calls out to him angrily and challenges his resolve&hellip;as a samurai. The word &ldquo;samurai,&rdquo; the purely notional title floating above his head, the empty promise of purpose he strove for, the prideful honor he was convinced excused his beastliness, all these illusory means of self-actualization for an ape with too much evolutionary intelligence to reconcile their ultimately primal raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre with the civility and mannered intelligence they so wish to embody as beings who see themselves above common animals despite their repressed instinct drove Fujiki to comply. Having seen Irako die, Iku had already slit her wrists, and as Fujiki stumbled back over to Mie, his only tangible reason to live unsubstantiated by the ideals which had just betrayed him, he finds she too had taken her own life, not being able to cope with his puppet-like, self-destructive decision. This is what titles like samurai do to people&mdash;what they&nbsp;physically, actually&nbsp;do to people&rsquo;s&nbsp;real, living, breathing lives. This is inescapable existential dread on the level of Texhnolyze and what the anime adaptation of Shigurui lacks, and despite it making the point to a solid degree, the fact it had the potential to become such a masterpiece later on in the story keeps me from saying I care about the anime to the depths with which the highest tiers of My Favorites List require, since I can only derive its fullest meaning from the manga which I haven&rsquo;t even read but the final two chapters of.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for reading, and blame that fucking asshole on /a/ who posted the manga&rsquo;s final pages without spoiler tags."}},{node:{id:1245,title:"Shihaisha no Tasogare",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/4277.webp",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/4277l.webp"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:5,num_episodes_watched:1,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2022-02-19T22:53:51+00:00",tags:["Just when I was starting to get bored of the Yoshiaki Kawajiri 90s pulp formula","Shinbou swoops in with this.

Their impressive lineup of animators offset their excessive CG, but they were vapid. Rebuild 4.0, however, feels like a real movie. It&rsquo;s about growing up and leaving anime behind, but I want you to ask yourself why leaving anime behind would be synonymous with growing up? Is watching capeshit the true sign of a grown up? Or maybe reading /lit/&#039;s Top 100 Charts and pretending you understood entry-level philosophers like Nietzsche or Hegel online is what true maturity looks like?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnno is such a hypocritical roach. Not only would he be a part-time debt slave, part-time shut-in if it weren&#039;t for the otaku who supported Evangelion back in the day, but he&#039;s also actively shitting on otaku despite being one himself. Does ANY part of these movies convey anything Evangelion originally stood for? Unit 01 transforms into a horse for fucks sake. If the countless new mechs and costumes didn&rsquo;t make it obvious, the Rebuilds are just toy commercials to rake in the cash after Gainax screwed Anno out of the original series&rsquo; holding rights, and yet trying to give them meaning with this finale somehow made them all even more offensive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnno&rsquo;s anti-escapism oozes with insecurity. He knows deep down he would never function as a salaryman due to how much of an autistic man-child he is, yet he fetishizes wageslaving as a response to &quot;escapism&quot; because deep down he understands that had Evangelion not been the massive financial success it was, he would most definitely be a hapless debt slave nowadays, if not a NEET. He&rsquo;s so insecure about his life and career being saved by those same &ldquo;immature&rdquo; anime fans he condescendingly passes judgement on, but he lacks the self-awareness to realize there&#039;s nothing more pathetic than someone biting at the hand that feeds them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRebuild 4.0 lives up to its predecessor by being another obnoxious clusterfuck, and it ends&mdash;spoilers&mdash;with nothing mattering and Mari, of all people, deciding to fuck Shinji, so the ultimate and final message of the Rebuilds is, &ldquo;Bro, just stop being depressed and wait for a pretty girl to literally fall out of the sky and give you the love you don&#039;t deserve but desperately need.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s such an aimless, slapdash conclusion. Sure, I suppose the love one usually finds in real life is also unexceptional and happenstance, and I get that&rsquo;s kind of what Anno was going for, but for a series as famous for allegory and metaphor as this, a conclusion of this nature feels bankrupt of any creativity or inspiration and instead just comes across like a scrap of cheap wisdom which could&rsquo;ve easily come from a fortune cookie. You can tell Anno doesn&#039;t share the mindset of his old depressed self anymore. Something as empathetic as the classic NGE cannot be written by the person he is now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for reading."}},{node:{id:3398,title:"Shin Hurricane Polymar",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1221/142865.webp",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1221/142865l.webp"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:5,num_episodes_watched:2,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2022-02-19T23:13:41+00:00",tags:["I'm sorry","but did someone say Yabou o kechirasu","tamashii no sakebi","kedakaku hoero","SOULTAKER!\r\nSekai o michibiku","hitosuji no hikari","kienai yume o","sono te te","SOULTAKER!"],comments:""}},{node:{id:1938,title:"Shin Kaitei Gunkan",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1327/92890.webp",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1327/92890l.webp"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:3,num_episodes_watched:2,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2022-02-21T02:54:53+00:00",tags:["Feels like a Takahashi thing","holy shit.

Please click the More button to the left of the score to see the Comments for my thoughts."],comments:"Anno has said if you&rsquo;re a normal, well-rounded person, you will learn nothing from Evangelion, and, not to be too dismissive, this is clearly reflected by any criticism of the series you can read.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs far as my sociability is concerned, Shinji Ikari is a character who would be nothing but a mirror if not for his hideously human, complex character writing which Hideaki Anno imbued him with back when he shared the debilitating depression Shinji and I are crippled by, and the prevailing reason he is so reflective of me and all which makes me who I am is the pitiable fact we&rsquo;re both autistic. Afraid of conflict, betrayal, heartbreak, or any other standard emotion inherent within intimate human relationships which only so-called &quot;normies&quot; can make piece with, Shinji, like me, chose to emotionally isolate himself to avoid feeling any of these pains. He isn&rsquo;t actively unpleasant in an effort to forcefully repulse others, but he certainly makes no effort to develop any of his passive relationships any deeper than superficiality. This leaves him like I have left myself, locked inside his own head wherein he does nothing but ruminate on his darkest thoughts and further deepen his distaste for others and especially his disdain for himself. Like mine, his life had become a seemingly endless cycle of fleeting encounters, unstable relationships, and wordless separations, separations which were products of the fact said relationships grew to be far too private and personal far too rapidly. But while those he so briefly connected with and latched onto were content to move forward, he did little but look back and rue what went wrong. For those of you who are fortunate enough to not understand this mindset, you have to try and look at this with a bit of empathy, even if it may not make that much sense to you. Any normie would feel sad losing a so-called friend, but you meet new people, forge new bonds, and most of all, let go of old ones. This is certainly a good thing, but if you hate yourself then why even try? At best, you&rsquo;ll feel guilty for someone who is reluctantly putting up with with the chore that is you, and at worst, they won&rsquo;t deal with your miserable personality and reaffirm your self-loathing by severing your relationship of their own accord. I mean, how could a relationship which includes you possibly turn out any other way? Like me, Shinji convinced himself at some point the best option is to just stop trying and stay down, even if the only one keeping someone like him or I down is our own childishness and subconscious insecurities. Shinji&rsquo;s character arc begins to reach what little catharsis depressives like us can hope for when he finally starts opening up to others and becoming okay with risking heartbreak in pursuit of connection and an understanding of himself and those around him. When offered to join the collective consciousness, despite thoroughly hating himself and despite the fact the only other human being who denied the offer themselves was Asuka, someone who vehemently detested him just as much as he himself, Shinji decides to reject the offer as well. Even when presented with the opportunity to take part in a reality devoid of the Porcupine Effect which had driven him into such unhealthy emotional extremes, he makes the brave determination to live on as his weak, lonely, depressed, dysphoric, likely suicidal self in the uncharacteristically courageous hope a day would come when he could find someone to accept him as himself. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs far as my identity and self-perception are concerned, Asuka Langley is another character who would be nothing but a mirror if not for her hideously human, complex character writing which Hideaki Anno imbued her with back when he shared the debilitating depression Asuka and I are crippled by, and the prevailing reason she is so reflective of me and all which makes me who I am is the pitiable fact we&rsquo;re both autistic. Simply put, she cannot accept who and what she is. She cannot accept she is, just like everyone else, nothing special. Like me, she grew up spoiled rotten and with a dangerously natural affinity toward elementary academia and an even more dangerous arrogance associated with receiving praise for the former by adults who lived too much of a life themselves as young people to truly comprehend the minuscule effort required for such results, so she&rsquo;s come to develop a subconsciously engrained and thereby utterly unfounded sense of pride. In fear of realizing, or more accurately, in fear of acknowledging the fact every man, woman, and child including her is equal, she lashes out at everyone and everything around her in an effort to place herself on a pedestal whereon she&rsquo;s protected from her actual social reputation: that of a conceited bitch living in her own glass world which no one wants to shatter, not wanting to take on the responsibility of making sure she doesn&rsquo;t cut herself with its fallen pieces. Like I did with Shinji, I&rsquo;ll assume you don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to be this low of a person and offer a short explanation from my own experience which I&rsquo;m definitely not proud of. As mentioned, Asuka is spoiled and proud, so she&rsquo;d stubborn by extension, and when you&rsquo;re stubborn, you better be right, too, because it&rsquo;ll be real humiliating when you have to retract and apologize on behalf of your entire life in order to correct your wrongness. Refusing to accept this horrifying prospect of modesty, Asuka, like me, convinced herself to double-down on her toxicity with those who know her and triple-down on her facade in the presence of those who don&rsquo;t since she&rsquo;s too cowardly to apologize and too immature to take responsibility for the years worth of hatred she&rsquo;s released upon the world. And it&rsquo;s at this point losers like her and I hit a wall. I don&rsquo;t have to deal with the age-gap like she does, but still, everyone around us are adults who are not fooled by our childish act. Everyone with even the slightest shred of the emotional maturity which we so sorely lack can see we hate ourselves clear as day. Everyone knows our confidence is a bluff not worth calling; everyone knows we&rsquo;re pathological liars who&rsquo;s charisma is not to be trusted; everyone knows everything. I know they know it as well, and I believe her final downwards spiral was in part due to her figuring out the same when her advances on Kaji fell on deaf ears. It&rsquo;s just a pathetic stalemate where we&rsquo;re too spineless to put in the hard work to mend and make genuine our reputation, and those around us are too despondent and uncaring to take responsibility for shattering our facade, as they rightfully should be. Her development comes in the clarity of her final moments when she finally humbled herself and simply became content with being judged by anyone other than herself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs far as my sexuality is concerned, Misato Katsuragi is yet another character who would be nothing but a mirror if not for her hideously human, complex character writing which Hideaki Anno imbued her with back when he shared the debilitating depression Misato and I are crippled by, and the prevailing reason she is so reflective of me and all which makes me who I am is not quite the pitiable fact we&rsquo;re both autistic, seeing as she isn&rsquo;t, but simply that we aren&rsquo;t normies and cannot accept the complexities of life with the same healthy acceptance of estrangement and knowing lack of complete understandings which they so naturally can. Like me, she is insistent on her emotional independence despite constantly self-destructing behind the scenes and doesn&rsquo;t like the idea of being dependent on a man, at least not publicly, even though her levels of sexual frustration are both far greater than any normie and persistent far beyond the scope of puberty when most lose that same passion. When she first became sexually active, she soon realized her partner was inexplicably and undeniably similar to her father who passed away when Misato was young after having a relatively strained and distant relationship with her. This troubled Misato deeply because she couldn&rsquo;t dismiss the possibility she was using her partner as an emotional replacement for her father, or that she even needed an affirmative father figure to begin with. This dilemma was put to words ingeniously in the final episodes of the TV anime by Hideaki Anno when he described her purposely exhausting, almost solely distractive sex life as &ldquo;a couple of depressed adults licking each other&rsquo;s wounds.&rdquo; In reality, though, like me, she&rsquo;s just so reliant on the emotional support of those she could latch onto behind closed doors that she became utterly petrified by the idea of loss. While her relationship with her father was negative in no uncertain terms, she still loved him, and the idea of losing Kaji, the man she had come to truly love, in the same sudden and wholly unsatisfying manner in which she lost her father terrified her. Even if it meant returning to her crippling loneliness, Misato would rather avoid the potential mourning all over again and shut herself away from the connection surely awaiting someone as motivated, capable, beautiful, and thereby not autistic as herself. Unlike Misato, I&#039;m autistic, so I have yet to commit to a sexual partner with the same admirable, normie-like, shameless abandon which she did, so I can&rsquo;t technically call her exact tangible misery relatable. However, given the fact her emotional hangups and insecurities are identical to my own in all their mental and hormonal complexities, the selfsame complex we both feel when single and unwanted, and my tendency to abuse masturbation&mdash;an act which coincidentally gives me the exact same feeling of release as cutting myself&mdash;as an emotional sedative exactly as she abused sex, I think I can confidently call her relatable if only theoretically. After all, it&rsquo;s our one difference which has her standing as the deepest character in the show for me, since her normie-like qualities and life choices which I agonize to comprehend remind me of what little in this world still confuses me, even having tread such a life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs far as my self-esteem is concerned, Rei Ayanami is, you guessed it, another character who would be nothing but a mirror if not for her hideously human, complex character writing which Hideaki Anno imbued her with back when he shared the debilitating depression Rei and I are crippled by, and the prevailing reason she is so reflective of me and all which makes me who I am is the pitiable fact we&rsquo;re both autistic. Rei is a mass-produced clone of someone else, so I obviously can&rsquo;t relate to that, but the mindset in which this leaves her couldn&rsquo;t be more relatable or easier for me to understand. Like me, albeit in a more supernatural fashion, Rei lacks any understanding of her parental figures, her colleagues, or really anyone around her, not to mention the staggeringly flawed yet universally accepted society which she lives in. Despite her usually stoic exterior, though, she is actually quite emotive when in front of her father figure, to both her and his apparent delight. When she later learns she was indeed a clone of her father figure&rsquo;s late wife, she begins to have a dramatic change of heart and deeply question her own nature. In particular, she&rsquo;s troubled by her father figure&rsquo;s perception of her and whether or not he cares for her as an individual or as a mere husk which he expects to grow into an exact replacement for his lost love. Like me, Rei is frankly pathetic and lacking any sense of self-worth whatsoever. I know you might think such expectations are unreasonable to impose on ourselves, especially since we&rsquo;re only assuming these expectations of us even exist in the first place, but if you don&rsquo;t value or see any value in your own presence, then it becomes increasingly easy to only concern yourself with others&rsquo; satisfaction with you and whatever value they may find within your meager existence. Since we don&rsquo;t particularly see any positive influence coming from ourselves, we want to be sure others can. We want to know how we can look the best to the people around us, especially our parents, but if we don&rsquo;t know for sure what they want from us, then how can we be sure we&rsquo;re not a disappointment? How do we know they&rsquo;re not getting tired of us? When you don&rsquo;t see any value within yourself and people aren&rsquo;t explicitly telling you they&rsquo;re pleased with you, it&rsquo;s easy to see why you&rsquo;d get so worried over whether or not they still want you around. Rei&rsquo;s eventual development comes when she stops asking what others want from her and begins to focus on what she wants for herself. She comes to understand not only the fact you don&rsquo;t have to conform to what others expect from you, but the fact others likely aren&rsquo;t expecting anything at all from you, so if you hold your head high enough, the only thing you really need to be is yourself, as cheesy as that sounds. Despite resigning herself to death in battle largely due to her determination no one would miss her if she was gone&mdash;a long-time reason with which I&rsquo;ve personally used to justify my past suicide attempts&mdash;Hideaki Anno makes sure to show you the enormous gut punch the cast feels when she gets replaced with another clone devoid of the personality they&rsquo;ve seen her work so painstakingly hard to develop over the course of the series having fought her way out of her shell.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKaworu Nagisa is more of an idea than a character, but an idea I can still connect with just as much, if not more than the characters I&rsquo;ve just discussed. Kaworu is a kind of wish fulfillment fantasy&mdash;more commonly known as &ldquo;self-insert&rdquo; fantasy among the modern anime fandom&mdash;for any character who comes into personal contact with him. Forgive me for getting off topic immediately, but I&rsquo;m going to go back to Shinji and Asuka&rsquo;s autism which I found so relatable for just one moment. Despite their shared intent on being isolated, they&rsquo;re like me in so far as they lack anything which could be called resolve. As soon as their stress levels start to rise, they immediately give in to loneliness, even if only in front of certain people with whom they feel comfortable enough being even slightly vulnerable around, or to repurpose a great Senjougahara quote, whichever poor souls decided to give these starry eyed virgins prone to falling in love with whoever shows them the slightest shred of kindness any attention at all. Shinji makes many attempts to connect with Misato and Asuka makes many attempts to connect with Kaji because their chosen others are adults, which is something they want to be very badly. Ironically, the fact Misato and Kaji are adults (and not autistic) is what makes them dismiss Shinji and Asuka so stubbornly, since they can only really see them as the children they are who are having a rough time through puberty and depression alike, and Misato, a fellow depressive, only ever makes exception to open up to Shinji on the occasions she needed to blow off some misery of her own. With Shinji and Asuka both being as desperate as they were at the time, Kaworu descends upon them like the angel he quite literally is, but he only succeeds in one case and for one very particular reason. Asuka had been out of sync with her precious Eva lately, so when Kaworu shows up to NERV out of the blue and syncs with her Eva perfectly, she&rsquo;s taken aback. I&rsquo;ve always imagined the point here was to inspire or motivate her through a sense of competition, something which she&rsquo;d been shown to be very passionate about in the past when competing with Shinji and Rei, but since she&rsquo;s the same brand of jealous I am, it has the complete opposite effect and sends her spiraling deeper and deeper into her depression. The difference, though, is with Shinji, Kaworu acts physically instead of attempting to influence him from a distance, and he succeeds because of this. Shinji, who, like me, has never had a true lover to warm his bed nor any sort of cathartic person to lull him to sleep, is suddenly put into very intimate contact with a dashing, confident, and assertive older man. Like me, Shinji has only ever been a bystander to sexual openness and has developed serious gender dysphoria because of it. Seeing as we both lack any sense of our own sexual identities and desires, we are both immediately and wholeheartedly attracted to whoever or whatever seems to want us. Nothing, not even gender will stop truly lonely people like us from accepting any bit of intimacy we can find, and it&rsquo;s in this manner which Shinji surrenders himself over to Kaworu so easily I can find such a painfully relatable dynamic in the idea that is Kaworu Nagisa and wish fulfillment fantasies in general. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor a good while, Evangelion is among the best directed, most strikingly storyboarded, and most beautifully colored, exceptionally designed, and generally well-constructed TV anime out there, but by episode thirteen, the series began to deviate significantly from the story Anno and Gainax had originally planned, and as the weeks of alterations, cancelations, and total redrafts went by, episodes of Evangelion were being finalized within days of their broadcast. Not only did Evangelion suffer from scheduling issues, but according to Anno, despite Gainax being the leading creative studio for the series, the company itself had inadequate materials and staff to support the production, and according to every source I can find, only three staff members from Gainax were actually working on the series at any given time, and the majority of the series&#039; animation was outsourced to Tatsunoko Production. The narrative shift which takes place around episode sixteen was planned in the sense that Anno, the writer and creator, was increasingly willing to trash the creative ambitions of the series in favor of the more character-focused story which it ended up being, but it was also spurred on by the staff simply not having the time or capacity to uphold the high-quality, action-packed production up until that point. As I&rsquo;m sure we all know, this all culminated in the series&rsquo; disastrous finale. Episodes twenty-five and twenty-six are certainly faithful to the themes and characters, but they are unimmersive lectures stitched together with nonexistent animation, simple line drawings, live action photographs, and fourth-wall-breaking dialogue played over still frames. In the end, Toshio Okada, writer and creator of Gunbuster as well as the former president and co-founder of Gainax, was quoted saying Evangelion&rsquo;s trainwreck of a production cycle was not only a problem of its poor scheduling and inadequate budget, but also a problem of Anno&rsquo;s inconsistent creative direction and inability to decide on an ending until the time came. Even The End of Evangelion, which many believe to be the ending Anno had originally wished for, yet was robbed of by the aforementioned scheduling and budgetary issues, is to me, in many ways, another cop-out of an ending riddled with forth-wall-breaking dialogue and annoying live action footage which takes you out of the otherwise engrossing experience. And none of this is even mentioning how obnoxious and pretentious the series can be. The word &ldquo;pretentious&rdquo; is hard to take seriously in the realm of anime critique because it has suffered the same fate as words like &ldquo;elitist&rdquo; in so far as it has become a buzzword used by pseudo-intellectual college kids who don&rsquo;t actually know the meaning of the word, yet have used it with such ubiquity as to have effectively changed its definition in practice. I hope this goes without saying, but that isn&rsquo;t me. I actually know the definitions of the words I use, and Evangelion is one of the few anime which actually fits the bill. To be pretentious is to feign a level of depth, sophistication, or worth than is actually possessed, and while I would say the following is made apparent by simply watching the show and needed no confirmation, both Anno and Tsurumaki have openly stated none of the Christian symbolism weaved throughout Evangelion&rsquo;s iconography actually means anything. So just like Ergo Proxy, whose creators Shukou Murase and Satou Dai have admitted is nothing more than a stylistic amalgamation of whatever they thought would look or sound edgy or cool, Evangelion, despite its profoundly meaningful depth of character, can also be called pretentious, and if you&rsquo;re like me and have something of an analytical mind, watching the series while having to remind yourself of the pointlessness of such elements can be honestly annoying.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUltimately, Evangelion is unto itself, and its perhaps dubious position on My Favorites List reflects the only place I could place it in good conscious. Back when I was firmly in denial, this was the part of the post where I&rsquo;d devolve into whatever criticism I could find to cite at least some legitimate excuse as to why I couldn&rsquo;t come to care about Evangelion intimately enough for it to receive an Eight, Nine, Ten, or whatever. The simple fact alone that Anno seemingly went out of his own way to present every shred of plot-relevant information through this lens of vapid symbolism which is used far more often to excuse brazen plot-holes and unexplained lore than it ever is to add thematic or visual depth, or to otherwise divert your attention from the fact said plot is utterly irrelevant to the thematic message at hand (and what he obviously wanted the story to be about) was more than enough justification in my mind to toss the series aside and move on with my life. However, no matter how much I tried to write it off as pretentious trash with the least likable characters in the history of fiction, the impact it left on me didn&rsquo;t fade for years, not for a single moment. In hindsight, my complaints, warranted as they may&rsquo;ve been and may remain, were little more than me trying to gaslight myself into thinking I didn&rsquo;t care, but I did, and I do, and I likely always will. Whenever I ruminate on these characters, especially Misato, I often burst into tears and plummet into suicidal thoughts on a level so bleak and hopeless, I&rsquo;m reminded of my time reading Inio Asano manga, like thinking of Midori raping Punpun for emotional release despite loving another man, or Isobe typing a suicide note in reply to a DM only to delete it and instead respond &quot;just killing time lol.&quot; Honestly, I think this is what makes My Rating System so perfect, not to talk myself up or anything. Rating by subconscious emotional connection and involuntary immersion means anime are on or off My Favorites List whether I like it or not, and usually, this was nothing but an annoyance. No matter how much I want to immerse myself in Paranoia Agent, my subconscious can&#039;t overlook the unforgivingly brutal whiplash between the creative staff and animation team&rsquo;s radically differing influences between certain episodes, even if half of them are total geniuses whose genius is etched into every frame they were involved with. No matter how much I want to immerse myself in Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei and its brilliant cast of personalities, my subconscious can&rsquo;t reconcile the ever-present metatext which pervades every facet of the imagery, characterization, and theme with the story itself, because traditional fiction has conditioned me into believing it to only be necessary in the latter, even though, without it, the show would be devoid of all the commentary which makes it such a clever comedy to begin with. No matter how much I want to immerse myself in Perfect Blue, my subconscious can&#039;t get a grip on immersion with Satoshi Kon&#039;s usual masturbatory amounts of tensionless, pointless, and surprisingly directionless sequences of characters physically running around in circles, even if that movie is&mdash;at least up until the last twenty minutes&mdash;among the most terrifyingly riveting, thematically profound, personally crushing pieces of cinema ever crafted. Evangelion is the first occasion where, instead of an anime being held off My Favorites List against my will, an anime is forced onto My Favorites List against my will, and I think the fact it&rsquo;s this series in particular will truly be healthy for me in the long run, even though the characters are only relatable via my most toxic and undesirably personality traits and do little more than make suicide all the more attractive, as if it could be so any more than it is now. If only I could apply the lessons which this post clearly proves I have learned.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for reading."}},{node:{id:32,title:"Shinseiki Evangelion Movie: Air/Magokoro wo, Kimi ni",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1404/98182.jpg",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1404/98182l.jpg"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:9,num_episodes_watched:1,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2022-02-12T20:41:22+00:00",tags:["Takes inspiration from equally legendary predecessors & pioneers of symbolic visual storytelling to send the characters off on their final journey of self.

Please click the More button to the left of the score to see the Comments for my thoughts."],comments:"Anyone who knows what they&rsquo;re talking about has already trashed this show to hell and back and discredited anyone dumb enough to defend it, and everything I could possibly say about it would just be repeating what others have already stated before and at much greater length, but you people keep demanding I explain my distaste, so here we go. Every point I&rsquo;m about to make is regurgitated from analysis which has long since been made. Enjoy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe central conceit of the story is that humans figured out how to modify their genome such that if someone were to kill another person with their psychic powers, they would immediately experience the &ldquo;Death of Shame.&rdquo; To make sure no one reaches that point in the first place, they&rsquo;re conditioned from birth to learn stress and power management and are given a place in society. However, some kids called Ogres are abel to bypass the Death of Shame and murder freely, while others whose powers are so strong they just leak out of their subconscious and passively destroy the world around them are called Karmic Demons, and generally both of these mutant outliers have to be put down. Had it been revealed that either of these were simply unavoidable genetic conditions which society had no way of dealing with, it would&rsquo;ve made sense that from the emergence of these conditions, society&rsquo;s oppressive fear of Ogres and Karmic Demons would lead to the present situation where children are heavily monitored and conditioned up through age seventeen, with any suspected of being potential Ogres or Karmic Demons getting culled along the way. But that isn&rsquo;t how things are explained. When the village elder tells her story of witnessing an Ogre in the past, it is suggested that the fact his mother was a part of the administration bureau had put him under an abnormal amount of stress, which in a system wherein the whole point is to condition kids not to feel stress, means he was conditioned incorrectly. In a society supposedly built around having a strong enough understanding of psychology to thoroughly condition the minds of its populace, it would&rsquo;ve been obvious to anyone that this divergence in the child&rsquo;s upbringing was the cause of his ability to bypass the Death of Shame, yet this detail is only mentioned in passing as a possible cause, and which somehow no one considered when making decisions about how to deal with Ogres from then on. In the episode-long exposition dump about this, the village elder literally excuses this by saying, &ldquo;But for some reason, no one seemed to be very worried about how abnormal he was.&rdquo; In every case we see of characters turning into Ogres or Karmic Demons, is it suggested to be the result of having too much pressure placed on them, something which this society is entirely based around preventing. Shun&rsquo;s power leaks out of his subconscious because there&rsquo;s such a high expectation placed on him to be the most badass psychic around, he feels incapable of just being a regular person like his friends. This is such an easy psychological hang-up to understand, the author of Shinsekai Yori understood it, but apparently nobody in the society built around managing stress did. Luckily&mdash;unlike everyone else in a society operating on the understand that we need to keep people from feeling stressed and out of place&mdash;Saki recognizes Orges are just people who feel stressed and out of place. Fucking brilliant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is pretty obviously meant to be a statement about the Japanese school system driving children to suicide, except the Japanese school system isn&rsquo;t based around managing children psychologically. If it were, it wouldn&rsquo;t have this problem, because they&rsquo;d remove every source of stress. Every dysfunction within this society are things which should be obvious to anyone who would be able to maintain such a society in the first place.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTowards the end of the fist arc, we see psychics dishing out epic levels of destruction, splitting the Earth in two, tearing through armies with a thought, launching trees like missiles at specific enemies whom Satoru can apparently see from miles away, and generally wrecking havoc on the Monster Rats, yet somehow in the final arc, the rats are able to totally lay waste to their village using&hellip;PRIMITIVE AMBUSH TACTICS?!?!?! Excuse me, I thought anyone psychic was supposed to be powerful enough to take down an entire civilization, and the humans didn&rsquo;t think of the Monster Rats as people, so how is it that the first time one of those rats killed a human, they didn&rsquo;t just genocide every Monster Rat off the face of the planet instantaneously by just IMAGINING THEM GONE?! And this is when the Ogre shows up and facilitates the #1 most irredeemable plot hole I&rsquo;ve ever personally seen in fiction. The library tells of an ancient weapon used to combat Ogres called the Psycho Buster, and apparently, the only place you can find it is in a weird looking capsule somewhere in the ruins of Tokyo. I&rsquo;m sorry, but why don&rsquo;t they have Psycho Busters on hand just in case this happens? When the village chief explains to Saki what happened when she witnessed an Ogre two hundred years ago, a doctor injects the Ogre with this shit to kill him, so how is it that within her extended lifetime, humans have just completely abandoned this method of dealing with Ogres? Were they just so confident that the mercenary Monster Rats and Impure Cats were enough to do the job that they dumped all their Psycho Busters? This entire society is founded on the fear of Ogres, but they didn&rsquo;t try to keep a Plan B on hand?! We&rsquo;re presented with no reasoning as to why the adults of the village wouldn&rsquo;t ALL be carrying around Psycho Busters at all times! If you can ignore plot holes this massive and integral to the internal logic of the story, then you are stupid. It feels liberating to be this blunt, since if I were to say something this honest in a review, it would get taken down, but yeah. You are simply a dumb person. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAny visual creativity and/or technical competency was 100% outsourced, totally half-assed, and completely directionless, containing zero artistic relevance to the themes or personality of the story (not that this show has any personality to speak of) and only being there to look vaguely and vapidly cool for a few seconds, and overall, this series has some of the most consistently off-model character art and nauseatingly ugly CG I&rsquo;ve EVER SEEN in ANY ANIME. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you can bring yourself to defend such a hideous presentation or excuse such brazen dumbfuck plot holes, I have less respect for your intelligence than I have for that of a clinically retarded chimpanzee. Ultimately, Shinsekai Yori is praised for the exact same reason Monster is. Teenagers and college kids can look at it from afar and think, &ldquo;Oooo, that looks smart! I bet I&rsquo;ll look smart if I watch it too!&rdquo; Only whereas Monster&rsquo;s biggest issue is mere vacuousness, Shinseki Yori is utterly broken.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI would say &ldquo;thank you for reading&rdquo; like I usually do, but remember, all I did was repeat other people&rsquo;s analysis. This is nothing new. I&rsquo;m not late to the party. You are."}},{node:{id:37662,title:"Shinya!

Please click the More button to the left of the score to see the Comments for my thoughts."],comments:"BECAUSE OF MY RECENT PROFILE UPDATES, THIS PIECE IS NOW OUTDATED. IT WILL BE REVISED AND EDITED SOON.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsually when I do this whole Too Long For The Tags thing, the Comments devolve into an existential downwards spiral hardly even relating to the anime in question until I remember to tie up the loose ends only after I&rsquo;ve defiled my keyboard with hours of typing, but you&rsquo;re in luck, at least this time, because all I really needed the extra room for was to offer a quote which the Tags couldn&rsquo;t fit. This quote is someone&rsquo;s analysis of season one, but it&rsquo;s my personal reason for finding inexcusable issue with season two:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;I would&rsquo;ve liked it a little more if the way the situation resolved in the last episodes isn&rsquo;t, uh, the characters are just irrational. Even though there&rsquo;s good reason for them to act the way they do, ultimately, it&#039;s like irrationality is why the events play out the way they do, which is always kind of lame from a storytelling perspective just because, like, you can make irrational characters do anything. You know? I feel like stories feel better when they have a strong logic behind them, but the world&rsquo;s not always rational, and the reasons given for the characters to act irrationally is good enough it didn&rsquo;t bother me that much. It was just kind of like an, oh, I guess that&rsquo;s what happened&hellip;they were dumb. *laughs*&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI agreed with everything they said about the show with the exception of this one thing, so it really stuck with me and came crawling back out of my memory when I watched the second season. I mean, just to clarify before continuing, I agree with their analysis of the show, I just disagree with their feelings on such. Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex is my favorite anime, so obviously I&rsquo;m a fan of logic above all else, but&mdash;as they acknowledged&mdash;the world is not always rational, some would argue its rarely rational, and its for this reason I think having some emotional takeover makes characters seem more human. Back on topic though, at the end of this second season, it&#039;s revealed the father of Konatsu&rsquo;s first child is Kikuhiko&mdash;or Yakumo or whatever you want to call him. This is the definition of a stretch. For one, neither character is prudent in their sex lives, and Kikuhiko himself has been portrayed throughout his entire life, which remember, WE&rsquo;VE SEEN, to be rather frigid. Even aside from their instincts, their established attitudes don&rsquo;t align with the events at all. Konatsu&rsquo;s entire life&rsquo;s goal has been making a name for herself in the world of entertainment on her own merit despite being a woman. She&rsquo;s the good ol&rsquo; Strong Independent Woman trope to a tee, and this is even further accentuated in her dynamic with Kikuhiko, because he&rsquo;s literally the only person on the face of the planet she doesn&rsquo;t want to be vulnerable toward&mdash;forget sexually submit to. While the same is true for Kikuhiko only for the opposite reason, he would never want to openly desire her for his almost chauvinistic pride as a rakugo master, he also just doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;or at least has never&mdash;viewed her as a woman, only as a child, a title he refers to her with many times. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI could keep rambling and break my promise this wouldn&rsquo;t be a long piece, but I&rsquo;d just exhaust my point. This season was very clearly concerned with exciting the audience with intrigue and twists, and while this payed off in truly shocking fashion when it&#039;s revealed the history of Sukeroku and Miyokichi&#039;s death which we knew from season one was Kikuhiko&rsquo;s lie, trying to shock us with this final reveal just felt off the mark and ruined the integrity of the character writing completely. Thus, this series as a whole didn&rsquo;t make My Favorites List. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for reading."}},{node:{id:25801,title:"Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu: Yotarou Hourou-hen",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/66057.jpg",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/66057l.jpg"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:4,num_episodes_watched:2,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2022-02-22T02:53:48+00:00",tags:["Cool","but it adapts exactly what the show does","so I can't really recommend it unless you're starved for this series."],comments:""}},{node:{id:27441,title:"Show By Rock!!",main_picture:{medium:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/73674.webp",large:"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/73674l.webp"}},list_status:{status:"completed",score:4,num_episodes_watched:12,is_rewatching:!1,updated_at:"2022-02-22T02:54:14+00:00",tags:["I'm so glad Bones is doing something new for once!!
